history_biography,"I never thought I could care so much about an eight-man collegiate rowing team. This book is highly skilled nonfiction and draws you in mentally and emotionally. I found myself caring so much about Joe, his story, and the rest of the boys in the boat. 
 The book skillfully weaves in America's history of the Depression and Germany's history leading up to WWII, connecting all the stories into one riveting narrative. 
 While reading the accounts of the various races, I'd find myself holding my breath, anxious for the oarsmen and the outcomes. I really, really cared about this story, much more than I'd have ever expected.",5
history_biography,"I argued with 99% of this book because it was mainly based off of Twilight, and I hate Twilight with a strong passion. The few parts I liked/agreed with were the parts that referenced Harry Potter. Not the best book, but if you want to know about RPatz early life, I would suggest it.",1

romance,"Playboy Johnny Duane Reed with all his charms and swagger is a love 'em and leave 'em type of man. Crystal Debrowski know this of him yet she couldn't resist falling into bed with him each time he flew into town. 
 Trying to move up the chain in her casino, Crystal suddenly gets caught up in counterfeit chip and money, and the next thing she knew, she's abducted into human trafficking across the world in Jakarta. 
 Now it's racing against time as Johnny tries to save Crystal before she's lost in the sex trade world. 
 This is an action packed book from beginning to end. Just when you think you can catch your breath, the next minute, you're holding your breath waiting to see what happens. 
 I enjoyed everything about the book, the plot, the characters, and the writing. Even in the most dire situation, Crystal was never a damsel in distress. She really surprised me with how she took care of herself. Johnny had always been likable to me but this book made him more endearing. 
 My favorite in the series so far!",5

But I was expecting it to be the end again, but of course theres another on the way and the Ali book that just came out that I hope my library gets in fast. This is deff always gonna be a fav sseries fir me as well as the tv show which comes back soon. If your not sure you should read this, you should. More secrets. New A possibilities.

history_biography,"See full review for Scrappy Little Nobody at: https://toomanybooksnotenoughshelves.... 
 Apparently, August was the month for books that I was hesitant to read. Scrappy Little Nobody was on that list because well...if you haven't noticed I mostly read fiction whether it be YA or literary, paranormal or contemporary, I only very rarely dive into historical (ignore the historical fiction binge I went on in 2015) and even that I know the truth is severely stretched and manipulated to fit the author's needs. So reading nonfiction/memoirs aren't norm for me. In fact, I don't read them at all. With the world being the way it is lately, I don't need 'realness' in my reading selections. I need fantasy and humor. I know what you're thinking now though, if that's the case why did I even bother adding Scrappy Little Nobody to my reading list? Well, to be honest, just because I don't read nonfiction, doesn't mean I'm completely against it and Anna Kendrick is kind of one of my favorite actresses of all time. I mean, Pitch Perfect was pretty much my favorite movie in my senior year of college. So I figured if I'm going to give this genre a try for the first time why don't I start with someone who I find ridiculously funny and sarcastic?",4
fantasy_paranormal,"Shadows by Christi J. Whitney 
 Shadows picks up at graduation, about 1-2 months after Grey ended. Sebastian graduated, he's still estranged from his friends and still a gargoyle. I thought we might get a moment where he reveals his secret to Katie early on, but it doesn't happen. Instead, Sebastian agrees to go back to the Romaney clan. This is clearly trouble. 
 Do I ever love the brotherly relationship between Hugo and Sebastian. Grey surprised me when it focused on it towards the end without ever letting up on also focusing on the romance with Josephine. It's nice to see characters who love their family, friends, and have romantic interests. We learn a lot more about the Romaney family in this novel, including their particular family dynamic. The Romaney's (with Nicholas as bandoleer) are more authoritarian than the Corsi clan, which made me miss the relationships between the Gypsy Ink Corsi's even more as the novel progressed. 
 There's a lot of talk about how Sebastian should accept himself and his gargoyle nature. There's a lot I don't know about this. That's partly because the nature of the Shadowen is kept secret. It seems like a not-so-good idea to me. This plot thread remains unresolved by the end of the story. There's a narrative split between the acceptance camp and the repression camp, and it's ultimately not clear which way will solve Sebastian's problems controlling himself. 
 Sebastian's life with the Romaney's is rough. There are new levels of terrible explored, and when you think it's not going to get worse, it does. No one likes him, and a big mystery about the nature of the Shadowen develops. One of the gargoyles from Grey returns, but he's a true, mindless monster now. The fear that Sebastian is going to turn is real. THE FEAR IS REAL. Like in Grey, Shadows pays off the emotional stakes at the end of the story. I suspected Shadows was going to have a downer ending, but that still didn't prepare me for how angry it made me. I need book 3 right now I'm not okay with my feelings at the end this book. 
 Josephine got a personality! She's still a quiet, sometimes 'too pure' character, but the rigid family structure of the Romaney clan shaped who she is. She doesn't have real friends; she's being groomed for an important role in gypsy society, so she's carried that responsibility from a young age. She's a girl who never got to be a child, and she's clearly repressed a lot of feelings. It's difficult to empathize with a guarded character because, well, they don't emote much, but Josephine comes into herself in Shadows. It's official: I believe in her as a love interest. 
 The new Romaney clan characters are strong. Zara, Phoebe, and twin Francis, who got some but not a lot of time last book, stand out. There are a lot of effortlessly likable characters in this story. There are also a lot of detestable characters in this story. Quentin wins the most hated character, hands down. I typically don't like when 'the other woman/the other man' is the default bad character, but the twist at the end of the story sold me on Quentin as a villain with his own, particular motives beyond 'easy love triangle antagonist.' Augustine makes an appearance again, and while he appeared more of a nuisance in Grey, he's advanced to the stage of The Chessmaster in Shadows. Augustine has a plan, and while some of it's clear, most of his secrets remain mysteries. Shadows ends on the biggest of cliff hangers, so don't expect resolution, even the bitter sweet kind, like in Grey.",5

 This is the story of two warring factions and how one person and a crew of misfits try to bring them to peace. On one side you have the Avicien, an ancient race of people with feathers for their hair and magic running through their veins. On the other side are the Drakharin, human like dragons. These two factions have been at war for centuries with massive body counts to show for it. In the middle we have a human girl named Echo (although that isn't her real name). She was brought into the Avicien's by the Ala when she was a small girl and has been pickpocketing for them ever since, even though some believe that she doesn't truly belong. 
 Everything Echo knows though is about to be supremely tested when a simple birthday gift for the Ala turns into a scavenger hunt for the legendary firebird, whose power is rumored to be able to stop the war. But she isn't the only one searching for it, Caius - the Drakharin Prince - is also on the trail, and he has his own purposes for the firebird.",5

fantasy_paranormal,"Thyra Winter is the Snow Queen, her powers gifted to her by Mael Voss. Her fate is bound to his task of assembling a magic mirror before she turns eighteen or else she'll become one of the disembodied wraiths that haunt her frozen castle. Thyra suppresses her emotions to deal with the oppressive nature of living with Voss and with the seeming impossibility of her task. The premise is interesting, but the focus veers away from all of that and delves into Thyra immediately trying to recruit a local yet somehow brilliant boy, Kai, to help her construct the mirror. This is a problem because Thyra's struggle with Voss and his old mentor, Sephia, could've made an interesting story if it would've been the focus. 
 Spoiler: it wasn't. Instead of this more interesting book, we get Thyra chasing a boy, Kai, and adopting a puppy, Luki. I ended up enjoying Luki as an animal companion, but the fact that the dog is the most interesting character in the story says something for how shallow the remaining characters are. Thyra's character veers into Frozen fanfic territory. No, really, it's Frozen fanfic. She uses the phrase 'Let it go' too many times for this to be a coincidence. This served to limit Thyra as a character for me, and she doesn't step beyond being a shadow of Elsa's (more vibrant and fleshed out) personality.

young_adult,"*4.5 stars* 
 I'm a big huge fan of the Across the Universe series, so I was pretty excited to get my hands on The Body Electric. Not to mention, the ebook was only $4.99!! It starts off a little slow but once the characters are developed, it picks up real quick. 
 There is a lot of unknown answers to Ella's life and once she meets Jack, she is even more confused. I loved going on the adventure with Ella and discover who she is and what happened to her Dad. Ella and Jack are just one complicated mess, obviously not their fault, slowly you get to find out the truth and it changes everything. There are plenty of surprises and lots of action. I only wished there was some more romance in there, that's the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. 
 I really could not put this down and enjoyed it very much! I love anything Beth Revis writes and will read anything she puts out there. Her creativity always blows my mind. I'm looking forward to the next book she writes.",4

children,"This book was full of amazing characters that will teach students about heartache and friendship. I loved the strong characters of Raymie, Beverly & Louisiana. However, the side characters of Granny & Mrs. Borkowski stole many scenes! Granny kept me laughing out loud as she out ran from the law & ""concocted a plan"" for the Rancheros. 
 Yet, I don't think this DiCamillo will appeal to all readers. Parts of the book drag & don't always seem to connect and resolve. I think my savvy readers will enjoy the story & characters and create their own endings for them but my typical 5th grade readers may struggle to get through this limited plot novel. I felt like this book was a mirror at times to Winn Dixie & I found myself preferring Opal's adventures. I myself, really struggled to finish this book but I'm glad I did. Five stars for stellar characters, but only three for appeal, story & pacing.",4
young_adult,"Since I hate sitting here and thinking of how to accurately express myself in the right words that aren't there when I need them, this will be considerably short. 
 -Footnotes, how I hate you. Especially when I can't find the darn number so I scroll through looking for it. And once found, I read the footnote immediately (some of which can get pretty lengthy) then realize I have no recollection of what dear Ruby was raging about. So a restart for me it is. 
 -Either my friends and I don't get out that much or Ruby's list (the amount alone, sheesh) was blown to a bit on the extreme side. I don't really understand why you care so much about a guy who didn't care for you more than a half day, yet you think about him all the time! Why? Specially when there's much, MUCH better ones out there. So as Will Smith as Hitch did to Albert, I too, double slap your face. 
 -Cricket. It wasn't really something she did (although I can't honestly remember what she did or at least not anything worthy of mentioning) but more of her name. Cricket. And whenever I did see it appear, I shivered because I do not like crickets or any other insects (and spiders, but nowadays you're weird if you're not deathly afraid of spiders). I honestly can't imagine anyone, not even those celebrities (and there have been some pretty crazy ones), giving a name like Cricket to their kid. A kid who you just suffered through 9 months of pregnancy and you name your kid Cricket? 
 -Jackson. WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT HIM SO MUCH? He wasn't even appealing in the way all the girls who read the book will dream about him for years to come. He wasn't even that great, nearly borderline hating. AND YOU STILL BELIEVED HE WAS THE BEST THING TO EVER COME TO YOUR LIFE? Argh. Open your eyes and see the amazingness that is Noel and forget about Jackson. Noel, who would have screwed up his perfect little reputation for your sake and yet you told him to fuck off. Why, why, why, oh why.

comics_graphic,"Rebirth of Thanos (SS 34-38). This is a nice setup for Thanos' return to the Marvel Universe that has an appropriately cosmic feel and does a good job of reintroducing a few of the major players. It bounces between epic and humor, and I found that awkward on the first read, but after I returned to it a second time I enjoyed it more, except for the ever-annoying use of the Impossible Man in the middle issue [7/10]. 
 It's nice to have (40) as an add-on to the story, but it's largely a setup for 41-43 arc that's not included. 
 Thaons Quest (1-2). These two special events do a great job of highlighting the Elders (and the In-Betweener) and introducing the Infinity Gems and the art on them is exquisite. However the quest itself is somewhat plodding [6/10]. 
 Before the Gauntlet (SS 44-50). This is very obviously treading water prior to the Infinity Gauntlet itself (especially the weakest issue, #49). Still, it's filled with good material. Two different spotlights on the Silver Surfer's character are the best elements, with a trip inside the Soul Gem being almost as interesting (and the best setup for the IG). I was also impressed by the daringness of a full issue without the Surfer. Overall, an interesting batch of stories that's worth reading. [7/10]. 
 The Infinity Gauntlet (1-6). As a product of its time, the main event is very strong, offering both a stellar cosmic storyline and a fun look at the Marvel heroes of the '90s and the universe's cosmic entities. The reset button at the end is the main problem with the series, but pretty expected given what occurs. [8/10] 
 Tie-Ins. Finally, it's nice to have the numerous Tie-Ins to the Gauntlet all collected in one place. They really vary in quality. The most distant tie-ins, like the Cloak & Dagger are the worst, but in general the cosmic issues (Silver Surfer, Quasar) are quite good. The Doctor Strange and Hulk issues lie somewhere in between but have their high points, such as the final Doctor Strange issue, which is the perfect conclusion for the volume. The biggest trouble with some of these tie-ins is the lack of elapsed time between issues of the Gauntlet, which puts a few of them in weird null time zones. Still, they're an interesting view of the Gauntlet and of Marvel at the time [6+/10]. 
 Overall, a nicely put together omnibus with a very strong core.",4

 (As you can see, I start reading ACOTAR from the beginning of the year. It takes really long time for me to get back to end this book.) 
 And I'm so so excited that I finally meet Rhysand. 
 He is so so so cute, humorous, brave, and sexy. I like his violet eyes and the words that said to Feyre. As he appeared in the story, I started to put the sticky notes on the pages with Rhys. (Fangirl reaction. LOL) Yeah, really crazy I know! But I love him much more than Tamlin! Can't wait to see him in ACOMAF. 
 The reason I can't give ACOTAR 5 stars is that it's a little bit too slow at the beginning. 
 It's kinds of torture to get pass through those plots. But it's worthy to get patient to read till the end. The final part of the story is better than the start. So if you are struggling with the slow-pace beginning, just try not to give up on it. While Rhysand shows up, all things will be fun. XD

 I enjoyed this book. 
 This book centers around the persecution of Jewish people in 14th century Strasbourg, and I quickly learned this was a huge gaping hole in my knowledge. (This is why books are awesome.) For that alone, I'm very glad I read it. 
 I thought the book was well written, although the dialogue seemed out of place. I felt like I was reading something that had been translated too many times. From the dialogue alone, I would have had a really difficult time pinpointing the time period of the book. Perhaps that was just to make it more readable for a younger audience though. 
 I'm always a fan of romance and the supernatural, so I loved that there is a tiny bit of both. Neither, in my opinion, took anything away from the gravity of the plot. The again, when it comes to massacres and the black plague, I'm not sure much could.

mystery_thriller_crime,"I was pleasantly surprised with Dig Two Graves. It was a little slow to start for me, but I am glad I stuck with it because I ended up not wanting to put the book down. Ethan is a professor at a prestigious college where he teaches the classics. He is a single father to a 13 YO daughter, Skip. He is also a former Olympic medal winner. His life is turned around when his daughter is kidnapped. 
 This will be a hard one to review because I don't want to give away any key plot points. I can say that what I really enjoyed about this book is that it kept me guessing. I enjoyed the ""trials"" that Ethan was made to go through by the kidnapper. Each trial that he succeeds at brings him closer to his daughter, but makes him lose something of himself in return. The 12 trials of Hercules was a unique idea. There are a couple of twists that were surprising. But the reveal at the end was a big shock to me. I think this book would make a pretty cool movie. 
 I highly recommend this one, especially to readers who love thrillers filled with rhymes and puzzles. I look forward to seeing what this author comes up with next!",4

 Lo primero de todo, quiero felicitar a B.A. Paris por este maravilloso estreno. !!Enhorabuena!! 
 Esta novela me ha tenido con el corazon en un puno del principio al final. Diria que lo lei de una sentada, textualmente, y me dieron las cinco de la madrugada hasta que lo acabe pues no lo podia soltar. 
 La historia esta narrada por Grace, la protagonista, casada con Jack hace 18 meses; y va saltando entre el pasado y el presente a lo largo de toda la narracion lo cual la hace sencilla de seguir y ayuda a mantener la tension durante todo el desarrollo. 
 Grace era una exitosa mujer de negocios antes de casarse y tenia a su cargo a su hermana Millie, con Sindrome de Down e interna en un colegio. Jack es un atractivo y exitoso abogado, defensor de mujeres maltratadas, que no conoce el fracaso. Son, sin duda, para sus vecinos y amigos, la pareja perfecta, pero... ?que sucede al cerrar la puerta? 
 Ya desde el principio notamos que algo no funciona. Grace esta nerviosa, muy nerviosa y la explicacion y el encaje de piezas nos llegara poco a poco, hasta dejarnos sin aliento. 
 No quiero contar mucho mas de la trama porque entraria en spoilers. Solo decir que me ha gustado el principio, me ha gustado el final y el medio; me ha dejado expectante, colgada de cada pagina, esperando girar la pagina siguiente. 
 100% recomendable a amantes de thrillers psicologicos. Este libro pasa directamente a mi estanteria de Favoritos y enciendo la velita del deseo que este ano me traiga muchos muchos mas libros como este; libros a leer de una sentada :D",5
history_biography,Interesting story about a young girl growing up to learn the challenges of the husband/wife relationship in the 1800s while also balancing the issues of running her own life as an independent business partner. By duping an American business man during her unconventional education into male/female relationships she starts herself on a path which will impact the rest of her life.,3
young_adult,"I was hooked from the beginning, my curiosity carried me and I'm glad it did. Elyse is such a force to be reckoned with, and becoming mute doesn't mean you've lost your voice, your true voice. You can still make others listen to you, even if it takes extra effort. Sebastian is definitely my favorite character of the book, he is so unique and quirky, so sure of what he wants and who he is that when people judged him or refused to accept him because he didn't embody the conventional idea of how a little boy should be or what he should like, it broke my heart to feel his sadness seeping through the pages. 
 The character development of both Elyse and Christian was extremely important due to the unfolding of the events in the book, all the characters are well-rounded and unique. I was impressed with how Ockler took such a beloved fairytale and turned it into this well-written and captivating story, making it contemporary but still magical to read. I highly recommend this book, both because of the story and the characters.",5
history_biography,"""I liked it"" - but it needed editing. An editor carefully cutting out about a 1/4 of the book (mainly: redundancies) might have raised this up to a 4 or 5. 
 It also sorta ends ten years ago (although the interviews are recent) - giving us not much a feeling for what Doc Watson recently, and Doc does still do some shows outside of Merlefest. However this might not be the author's fault, as Doc has become more private (as mentioned). 
 I confess that I'm also lot more sympathetic to Ralph Rinzler's way of getting Doc in the music business (as a trad performer) than the author is. The author also probably tells more of Merle's problems that the family would have liked him too. 
 On the other hand, ""I liked it"" - he did a lot of research and interviews, and the book tells the life story of Doc Watson. It gives a good feeling about what other musicians think of Doc and his influence on musicians. If I could give half stars, I'd give it 3 1/2.",3

 Part 1 in a new spin off series 
 My The Bachelor Auction Review . . . 
 When needing a good laugh Rachel Van Dyken is one of my go to authors. So, when I found out that this new series was based in the same world as the Bet Series I jumped at the chance to read and review it. 
 In this new series we have a modern day Cinderella story with millionaire Brock Wellington and near invisible Jane and her evil sisters. After a tragic loss and regretful words, Brock has turned into a yes man even if its the last thing he wants to do. 
 Now forced to auction himself off to save the family and the family company, Brock is forced to deal with his demons via his scheming grandfather. With Brock facing a bleak future he finds a wide eyed girl who needs saving but how does he get to know her more when she leaves the party with no name or number given. With the auction looming in the future Brock is forced to go on vacation at his childhood ranch. 
 Jane may be the youngest sister but she keeps family close, unfortunately her sisters don't feel the same and use and abuse poor Jane. After given the opportunity to have a working vacation to clean a ranch home, she jumps at the chance to get away from her sisters. 
 Even though these two have met before the second meeting doesn't go as well, while Brock is facing his demons. 
 ""The real hammer, not the sexual one you're envisioning in your mind in order to distract me from the fact that you're a spoiled, silver spoon-fed city boy with the brain of an gnat."" 
 Jane helps Brock to deal with his past and vice versa since these two quickly realize they have a lot in common. 
 ""Boring, Brock?"" Jane asked. ""It's about as bad as it sounds."" ""Well, I'm Plain Jane so . . . I understand."" 
 Finally Brock wants something or someone for himself, but how does he save the family and get his girl? 
 ""Sometimes it's in the place you least expect it, like in a house full of ghosts and with a girl who carries bleach in her purse."" 
 With the help of fellow scheming mastermind Nadine Titus from the Bet series, Brock can finally get his cake and eat it too. I have to admit I quite adored this book and it has tons of potential especially where the twins are concerned, but I didn't think this book was as funny as some of RVD's previous books have been. Don't get me wrong there was tons of fun but the balance tipped to the more serious then humor this time around, which is great but I wasn't expecting it. Did I still like this book? Absolutely. Will I read more from this series? In a heart beat.",4
children,"This book is SO.MUCH.FUN. It's a very rhythmic read: ""hand, hand, fingers thumb, one thumb, one thumb, drumming on a drum,"" which makes it a whole body experience for both of us. We read it together and beat on the floor to the rhythm, occasionally stopping to point out a plum or other interesting illustration. My son, 20 months, asks for it by name now: ""dum ditty dum DUM!"" because it has all his favorite things in it: monkeys, loud noises, a chance to hit things, and more monkeys. If not his favorite, this book is certainly in his top five.",5

 If you liked Willing Victim by Cara McKenna then you will like this book. This book was really good but it took me awhile to get completely engaged with it. I don't know if I wasn't originally in the mood or what. With darker themes you have to be in the right head space to truly enjoy the experience. It take a bit for me but eventually I was hooked and fell in love with Jonah and Vivienne. 
 Since a teenager Vivienne has craved a dark sexual need but hasn't found anyone willing to fulfill it for her. This need-it drives her, it torments her, it haunts her. After being publicly out for her darkest desires she finds comfort in a dark stranger. A stranger that wakes up things she didn't know even existed. A stranger who also shares just as dark as a need. 
 ~ The harm is when the lines between reality and fantasy get blurred. Like they did last night. ~ 
 Jonah has his own issues but finds a match in Vivienne. Quickly but safely these two embark on a journey to give each other what they need. 
 ""It's your fantasy, and mine. Chances like this don't come along often-two people twisted in the exact same way."" 
 Even though Vivienne is filled with tons of shame for her wants, she knows something about this feels also right. 
 ~ That ought to scare the shit out of me, except-he's right. I do want to play rough. I want the dirtiest, filthiest brutality, and I want it badly. Wanted it for so long.~ 
 With these desires also causes vulnerability. There's a very slippery slope where these two are concerned. They both know what they need but they don't know each others whys. 
 ""I just want to ask why."" ""In my experience, the answers to questions like that usually fail to satisfy."" 
 This whole fantasy/reality line is a journey for Vivienne. But a healing journey. Finally she has found her equal. Her match. Someone who believes her. 
 ~These days I don't hate myself for having been raped. I hate myself for wanting to act it out all over again. ~ 
 Just because they need each other also doesn't make it right. 
 ""No. But don't you see? I don't just fuck you, Jonah. I bare my soul to you. . . "" 
 The more they play the more the line gets crossed. The more the inner torment seeps in. 
 The best move is not to answer him, now or ever. 
 I click reply. 
 Because of their needs it makes this relationship to so much more than it was originally supposed to be. 
 ""Really you only know one important thing about me. But the one thing you know is the simple most intimate, private thing I've ever shared with anyone. That's why I said I bared my soul to you, every time. That's why this relationship feels like - "" 
 Now trying to decide to have their desires met as well as being honest with their emotions is tough on both of them. This is not an easy relationship to begin with and they're both walking on a live volcano of emotions and feelings. 
 ""Exactly. The fantasy isn't your problem; it's the extremity of your fixation on it. Who is it who won't let you find sexual satisfaction any other way?"" 
 The truth of the past comes out. It's not a pretty past. It's dark and sad. But it's also the bond that holds these two together. Can they find their way to a lighter future together? Or are they going to be chained by their dark pasts? Only time will tell and now we have to wait till September to see if these two can make a real relationship between them.

 The writing was fantastic, the pace was perfect, and Holder is still as dreamy as ever. I read Hopeless about 3 days before Losing Hope, and I never got bored, because there was so much that was new.

It really made me think about what it means to be an American, and examine the privileged I am afforded by having been born here. I also loved the quotes that were at the beginning of each chapter, they were great and relevant to the story.

 I've always liked Burrough's novels, and I've read his original four novels quite a few times and they remains as funny as when I first read them, but this christmas themed book definitely feels like a simple cash-in for the holidays. 
 The stories are also somewhat jarring, as if the book is split into two sections. The first few stories have some genuinely funny moments from his childhood, like the confusion of whether Jesus and Santa are the same person, and when his attempt at making a gingerbread house ends up more resembling a crack den. 
 These first few stories have an innocence to them that lends to humour well, but after that there are stories about having one night stands with a random Santa Claus twice his age, and a story where he sleeps with 'the bum's during Christmas Eve, that aren't particularly funny, or as scandalous as the author seems to want them to be. 
 Overall, I'd give three stars to the first three or four stories, but only one star to the final three. Disappointing.",2

history_biography,"As an introduction to Jefferson, this book is adequate. The illustrations are beautiful. Significant relationships, Jefferson's divergent interests and many accomplishments are referenced, however, I felt it dwelt quite a bit on the ""negatives"" of Jefferson - particularly in regard to slavery and Sally Hemings - which form the opening page. 
 The account of all the people Jefferson lost (sister, mother, sister, best friend, wife, daughter, etc) serve as a stark reminder of the mortality rates of the time. I would have liked more context on whether or not his losses were typical in a large family of the colonial time (I think they were). 
 His political development and Presidency in particular need supplementation. 
 Finally, the Sally Hemings relationship is presented as fact, whereas all that we know is that her children were related to the Jefferson line. Whether or not her lover Thomas Jefferson himself or another relative (many of whom were regularly at Monticello) is not clear. It bothers me to account as fact an accusation that was started as campaign slander 200 years ago. The Monticello website had a much more balanced treatment of the topic. You can read it here:

mystery_thriller_crime,"I enjoyed the first book in this series, The Dirty Book Murder, so I was looking forward to Left Turn at Paradise. Unfortunately, it ended up being just an OK read for me. I was hoping for more of a mystery. The story started out that way, but then it turned into a weird ""adventure"" type book in the New Zealand wilderness. It just wasn't what I was expecting. The story was also heavy with description and history lessons. It slowed down the plot and made me skim a few areas of the story. 
 The other thing that confused me was Michael. I felt like his personality was different from the first book. He claims to love Josie, but he cheats on her. That really made me lose respect for him. I didn't buy the claim that it was for the sake of finding the book and staying on Pillow's good side. You all know how I feel about any type of infidelity in books I read. It makes the story lose major points for me. 
 This one can be read as a stand alone. I didn't feel like you had to have read the first book in order to read this one. So if you missed The Dirty Book Murder, you can read this one without feeling like you are missing something.",2

Instead they take him to a house where he's asked to find a missing girl who's been abducted. They ask him because they know who he is, a former United States Marshall. His own daughter was abducted and after that, he became the person who searched for children who were taken by a parent. 
 This child, Lindsay Sorkin, was not abducted by a parent, but by a stranger. After talking to the parents, Fisk agrees to take on the case. 
 At that point, the book races to the end, from town to town, country to country, death to near death. Fisk moves through nightclubs, dark alleys, and his own dark memories. The goal of all this is to find the young girl and save her from a very black future. 
 The story moves fast and I quickly turned pages. By the end of the book, Fisk is looking not for one person but for two. It is a very unexpected twist that will shock the reader.

First issue is a get out and vote type thing, which I guess is timely for New York since state and borough positions are open for voting, but definitely odd to see in a comic book geared for teens. The middle storyline is interesting, but I still have no idea how a computer virus can infect people's brains. The side story with Zoe and Nakia was a nice touch and I love how it was handled. The last issue follows Bruno's adventures in Wakanda. We see he can't seem to stay away from mischievous people even when he's injured.

 Penguin Plans (5-7). It's nice to see how the organized crime of Gotham fares in the New 52, but parts of this story are a bit incoherent for some reason. [5/10].

 Tapenum's Day is the only one of the set that is NOT biographical.

mystery_thriller_crime,"VIRGEN OF THE WIND ROSE, THE 
 by Craney, Glen 
 a novel of espionage in the end times 
 Jaqueline is a literalist Christian involved in an evangelical group that believes in the rapture. She leans on the Rev. Merry for support, admires and trusts him. As the book opens she is waiting for the return of her fiance, Paul. But Paul doesn't return; he has been murdered in Ethiopia, not even the place where Jaqui thought he was. Determined to find out the truth about what happened and who he really was, Jaqui, an employee of the State Department USA heads to Ethiopia despite protests and warnings from her work superiors. From here, rather than resolving anything, her questions multiply and she feels driven to pursue the answers in the Middle East, the USA and even Canada. Her emotions become complicated when she meets a stranger in a church crypt in Ethiopia, at once threatening and attractive. 
 In a parallel story, three young men, members of the Order of Christ in thirteenth century Spain and Portugal engage in a plot for the Portuguese king against Spain in a quest to find India and all her riches before the Spanish do. That is what the Portuguese want Spain to think, anyway. The story is an entanglement of secret agents, Queen Isabella, peremptory deaths and betrayals and the struggle to succeed. 
 The mystery surrounds, on the one hand, what happened in history around the discovery of the New World, Christopher Columbus, and a quest to discover the Jewish Ark of the Covenant, hidden after the Roman destruction of the Jerusalem Temple; and, on the other hand, the modern belief based on prophecy that the Temple must be rebuilt in its original site, the Ark restored, and sacrificial rituals resumed before the End Time can come. Much of the mystery relies upon the deciphering of codes left by generations of descendants committed to protecting the secret location of the Ark of the Covenant. 
 Craney's writing is direct and well-paced. The characters are believable and well motivated. The historical material feels realistic and true to its era. Readers who are interested in cryptology will love this book, as may espionage and romance-suspense readers, the latter as long as they don't require that all will turn out well in the end. Some of the plot needs the suspension of belief when an international art thief moves about the world with ease, as well as our protagonist who both manages movement as well as figuring out the codes fairly rapidly, albeit step by step. The plot development intrigues, especially for those who can process and remember where we are in the decoding process. The serious reader might wish to keep a notebook by his/her side. 
 We gain insight into the murky world of interfaith relations from the times of peaceful co-existence to the Inquisition to the modern-day tensions of the Middle East. In this context we see how really closely related we all are, and how the strains of Judaism, Muslim and Christian intertwine in our own geneologies. Particularly, we have the opportunity to reflect on how powerful and would-be powerful people manipulate our racial and ethnographic differences in order to divide and conquer. In between the lines we can see the folly of humankind allowing itself to be so manipulated and a remote possibility of an ever-receding peace. 
 Craney's book provides much entertainment, historical imagination and insight, as well as fodder for serious reflection on current events.",3

fantasy_paranormal,"""Cades Cove: The Curse of Allie Mae"" is a ghost story written in current times with bits of history, tradition, and ancestry thrown in. 
 David and Miriam Hobbs venture to a secret place in Cades Cove that is reportedly the 1800's version of Lover's Lane. They see hearts and names carved on the old trees, and one of the names is Allie. Later they find an old treasure bag with Allie's name embroidered on it. David takes the bag home to Denver and the ghost story begins. Allie turns out to be a hateful poltergeist that terrorizes David's family. Of course you'll keep reading to find out how they get rid of her and who she is. The family connection at the end between Allie and David is intriguing. 
 When the family can't take any more of Allie's deadly mischief, David takes Allie's bag back to Cades Cove and enlists the help of a Cherokee Indian guide and his shaman daughter to get rid of Allie. After intense spells and a flashback to Allie's gruesome death, the story ends, and all is well.

And I think that us women are drawn to the bad boy who we think we can fix so she really is that far off. It's still an ok read. Just not one of my favorites.,3

history_biography,"My copy of The Double Life of Mistress Kit Kavanagh was sent to me by The BookBag and my review was originally published on their website. 
 In early eighteenth century Ireland, young Irish beauty Kit Kavanagh lives a quiet, settled life in a Dublin alehouse with her husband, Richard. When Richard is suddenly whisked away to join the British army, Kit disguises herself as a man and enlists as a soldier, determined to follow and find her husband across war-torn Europe. 
 The premise alone sets up The Double Life of Mistress Kit Kavanagh to be an exciting and interesting read, and it certainly lives up to its expectations. I mean honestly, it's about a woman who masquerades as a man to go and rescue her husband - she's no helpless damsel and she rocks. From the novel's opening pages the story immediately takes off and Kit's life is drastically changed from simple housewife to fearless dragoon, bound to set sail to the bloodied lands of Italy. As a reader, being immediately thrown in to the action is what had me gripped from the start - Fiorato's writing gives you detail without weighing the story down and it's very well paced. There's no dawdling about or useless rambling - just bam, you're in the action and that made everything so exciting. What perhaps made the story particularly interesting is that it is based on fact, since Kit Kavanagh was a real woman who fought in the British Army during the War of the Spanish Succession. Fiorato's novel is of course fiction but it's woven around factual details which gives the story its clarity and makes it feel grittily realistic. 
 The novel is split in to two parts: the first part focuses on Kit's life as an army soldier and having to conceal her identity from her fellow officers. The second part leads to Kit once again dressing as a woman when she is recruited by the cunning Duke of Ormonde to be used as a spy against the French. At first, I enjoyed the first half more than the second, but Kit's double life as a political pawn became equally as entertaining as her life as an army dragoon. The beginning of the second part did feel like things were moving more slowly since Kit had to once again start over and recreate her identity. Having said that, the novel worked well at keeping me guessing and Fiorato succeeds in executing a very entertaining recreation of a real woman's journey. 
 Set during the early 1700's in the middle of a war, the plot is quite history heavy. There's a lot of detail about why the war is taking place and who is fighting who and even the history of the European monarchy. Being historical fiction this is somewhat expected, but Fiorato incorporates this necessary detail very well. Plus, the story is principally a tale about Kit's adventures so you learn everything along with her and it's fascinating in addition to being vital to the plot. 
 Kit is a brave and unpredictable heroine and I loved how she continued to grow stronger and bolder throughout. Seriously, she's so boss and fearless which is everything I love in a female character. She comes across as kind of an Irish Mulan but seeing as they were both women who dressed in men's clothes and went off to war it's kind of hard not to see the similarity. Despite her reason for going to war being to search for her missing husband, she comes in to her own and the story takes lots of twists and turns that I wasn't expecting, but it kept the plot bobbing along very nicely. Kit forms a close bond with her commanding officer, Captain Ross, and their friendship develops wonderfully. Kit and Ross were actually the only characters I was rooting for, since many of the smaller characters - Kit's comrades and such - are virtually interchangeable. 
 There are however some wickedly brilliant antagonists who are characterised especially well in that they are both complex but very believable in their actions. A lot of them made me want to get in between the novel's pages and kick them in the groin, but it's okay because Kit does that for you and she absolutely rocks at it. 
 I'm so glad I got the opportunity to read this since beforehand I had never heard of Kit Kavanagh, but this novel just proves that history has some amazing women that went against the grain of convention.",4

poetry,"Darra's father steals a minivan, and a little girl. He only knows about and intended to steal the car. Darra suspect that Wren might be in their garage, but she doesn't dare tell her parents. A few years later, they both end up at the same summer camp. They don't recognize each other by sight, but by name. The girls are forced to face something they would both rather forget, but by sharing their story maybe they can forgive. 
 This was a very intense story about the girl who got accidentally kidnapped and the other girl who knew she was there. I loved how the story was written in prose poetry. Also, Darra's part was even more than just the straight-foward words, because the words at the end of the longer lines, told a story of their own. This was a brief story, and I wish we got more insight into Wren's family. It seems like we never find out too much about her and end up knowing a lot more about Darra. I love that they meet a summer camp and are forced together. It wouldn't have been a completely different thing if they never met each other. The voices were very true to the ages of the characters, you can see a vast difference from eight-years old to fourteen, especially for Wren. This was a compelling story about how one viewpoint might not hold all the answers and how to girls who want to forget eachother can break through that and make themselves both feel a lot better.

 sitting in our gold minivan,

comics_graphic,"Saitama, aka the One-Punch man literary beats his opponents with just one punch! This is how strong our hero is. Already laid-back even before he became the world's strongest hero, eventually he got too bored because no monster has ever posed a real threat to him. Saitama has all the strength of Fist of the North Star's Kenshiro who is always nonchalant like Naruto's Shikamaru. 
 Plus, he's bald. 
 One thing very noticeable with One-punch man is that it does away with lengthy back stories and complicated plots. Rather, the manga throws you right away with outrageously boombastic fight scenes from almost cover to cover. No shitty dialogues and corny lines, just pure martial fun. 
 I may have outgrown this type of manga (or may have read too much Kazuo Koike creations), but One-Punch man is downright funny and entertaining. The dullest moments I've read are Saitama's backstories prior to him going bald but those scenes are way more than just being mediocre. 
 The monster designs in one-punch man are detailed, regardless of how long their screen time is. I find it so hilarious when most of them have very serious motivations to invade earth, only to be thwarted by a seemingly uninspired protagonist. With this regard, I must honorably mention Vaccine Man! 
 One-Punch may not be anymore suited for my age but one cannot ignore how good it is. Looking forward to reading the second volume.",4

Shrouded in mystery the Reapers are a blend of Light and Dark Fae who are chosen by Death to maintain the balance between Light and Dark. Learning the back story of the Reapers is fantastic, considering their pasts and all that had to be overcome to work as a seamless unit. 
 Kyran, a Dark Fae, is the focal point in Dark Alpha's Embrace. Having a tragic and heartbreaking past, his character remains strong and his loyalty runs deep for those he holds dear. 
 Living life as a simple human, quiet book loving River refuses to be a damsel in distress to stand up to the Fae who dare to take her books. With her fiery personality and unique history, River is challenged to look past all that she has known.

mystery_thriller_crime,"** spoiler alert ** 
 I did not see this one coming at all! 
 The best way to describe this book is... Highlander meets Buffy meets Superman meets Lord of the Rings! 
 The vampire federation idea is clever - a more sophisticated Buffy! The sword swishing was all about highlander ""there can be only one"", the goblins definitely made me think of LOTR, and the twist... aliens from space - of course, superman. 
 This is my first book by this author & I have to admit that I was convinced it was not my thing when I started. It had the gore, blood and description typical of horror movies - I have never read a book like it. 
 BUT, as you read you got involved with the complex characters - and boy are there MANY of them! Even I lost track of who was who at times! 
 If you enjoy action, adventure and gore - this is the book for you. 
 Overall, I really enjoyed it and was left wanting to read more. It is obvious this is a series since the story is left unfinished... and you get a teaser into the first book. This is the only thing that annoys me - I prefer to know how many books it's going to take to finish the story.",4

 Add a star if you're a preteen 
 If you read and loved the Percy Jackson series, especially the first book, The Lightning Thief, this story might sound a bit familiar to you. Carter and Sadie find out that powerful gods inhabit the real world and these formally ordinary kids discover that they have a vital role to play when it comes to maintaining balance between the humans and the gods. 
 So, the story is a bit derivative and definitely patterned after the Percy Jackson series, but it is a damn good formula that Riordan is following- so considering the action, the appealing main characters, the interesting Egyptian mythology (though not as compelling as Greek mythology IMHO) and bits of humor, this book should still be a solid hit with young readers.

But Mark has mad survival skills and a lot of equipment that was abandoned by his mission. The author often lost me with the maps, math and science (which have been fact-checked and approved by NASA personnel) but the survival story is absolutely riveting. Most of the tale is told in the format of a journal kept by a man who believes he will probably die but intends to survive as long as possible in case someone can mount a rescue mission. The rest of the story occurs on mission control on Earth and on the spaceship that reluctantly abandoned their crew mate. This book had been on my Kindle for months.

 Made me want to read more Virginia Woolf. And D.H. Lawrence and definitely Tristam Shandy.

It made me reconsider Joyce as a someone I might someday read (I *think* I once read part of the Dublineers and was bored stiff EDITED: Have read most of Dublineers, WAS SO BORED that I couldn't make myself go through the 3 stories I had left), especially Portrait of The Artist as a young man, which, to be honest, I was eying anyway because it has the best title ever, but not just that. 
 I was also very interested in the concept of the comedic plot. 
 From minute 18, lecture 16: Comedic world: a logical place where good is rewarded, bad punish. Nature is balanced. A tragic world leaves us in doubt. Also, in a comedic world everybody will get married at the end. The status quo will be maintained. And how at one point English novelists realised that it was hindering progress, that they weren't telling the stories of all the people that were not happy with how things were (women, working class, etc). Tragic plots, on the other hand, end with injustice, with a world that is not evil in intent but, even worse, indifferent, whatever we do has no effect in our future. A terrifying concept even nowadays for people who keep trying to create something out of chaos, give life some structure, give ourselves some measure of control. 
 I liked that it ended up with modern living writers, there's some people there I really want to check out, as well.",3
romance,"3.5 Stars. This is a family M/M novel that involves two separate families in modern Boston. There are real struggles, and no steam. The bulk of this story occurs in 2009. 
 Jamus is nearing his grad school graduation when he's in a car wreck that kills his parents and leaves him as custodian of his 3 y/o brother, Nick. He's not a parent, and he's not a brother. As their life moves on, he accepts the parental role grudgingly. The book mostly centers around the time when Jamus is 35, and a successful author in his own right, caring for Nick who is now 14 y/o. In the time he's cared for Nick Jamus has had no social life, and only occasional one-night stands when Nick was old enough for sleepovers. He poured his heartache of loss into his novels which are LGBTQ stories--and is an out-gay man in the South End neighborhood of Boston. 
 Sean is the youngest of four kids in Southie. He's 26 and just graduated with a PhD in education. He takes a low-pay teaching job (not sure why this is his best option--I have a PhD and teaching paid pretty well even with my limited experience) at a private school in Cambridge. The same school where Jamus' brother Nick is a freshman; and in his English Lit class. Sean is being hounded by his family to settle down with a girl--which was also perplexing, as his two elder sisters who must have been nearing thirty were neither settled nor dating anyone of relevance and his elder brother Kevin is not facing this same scrutiny. Kevin is a rock--back from two tours in the Middle East and recovering from mild PTSD. There is a woman, Grace, who is adored by the family and who has plain attraction to Sean, but Sean is not interested. He's not sure why, mainly, and doesn't figure out until 65% through the book, when he meets and interacts with Jamus, that he might could be gay. 
 This is a really interesting story of family dynamics, coming out, and self-sacrifice, but suffered in the romance department. There is absolutely no steam, and I was not convinced that there was much of an attraction. It's entirely possible that book-loving Sean was enamored of Jamus' status as a successful author and intrigued by his first gay experiences, but not really a good match. There is a big falling out, both with Jamus and Nick--regarding backlash at the high school, and Jamus' role in the wreck that killed their parents. The catharsis of his fiction leads Jamus into trouble with Nick, and the homophobia surrounding Nick's guardian is absolutely horribly managed in the high school. Considering the expense of private schooling in New England, I was stunned that there was so little remedy to Nick being bullied. Sean is outed against his will, and it leads to strife that is not managed on the page. Young Sean runs to a safe harbor, and we only get snippets of there being any resolution to that problem. 
 The romance between Jamus and Sean is tentative and even when it is not it's subdued. I wanted to see some heat between these guys. Alas, no. Sadly, I guess we only get to see their frailties bared on the page. I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley.",4
children,"Apenas um desejo foi dos livros mais ternurentos que ja li. E tao facil sentir carinho pela Charlie, pela Bertha, pelo Gus e por toda a familia de Howard. 
 Embarcamos nos sonhos da Charlie e um privilegio para o leitor. Charlie e genuina, cheia de garra e com uma percecao sobre si propria que muitos adultos nao tem. E uma criancas que apenas precisa de amor, que precisa de sentir que pertence a alguem. E de apertar o coracao ler acerca de uma menina que sentia que nao pertencia a ninguem. E, pior ainda, e ver que ela sabia que isso nao era algo muito comum na vida das criancas. 
 Charlie, uma crianca feita de sonhos, que acredita nas estrelas cadentes capazes de tornar os desejos em realidade, ve-se obrigada a lidar com algo muito duro na vida de uma crianca. Porem, a resiliencia dela suplanta qualquer expetativa da parte do leitor. Ela seguiu o seu proprio caminho, deixou-se absorver pela sua genuinidade e pela sensibilidade que ela foi alimentado dentro dela. Toda esta mistura de cores que habitam dentro dela tornam-na especial e muito realista. Eu consegui ver aquela crianca, como se ela estivesse ao meu lado. E depois temos a forma como ela lida com o Osso da Sorte e com o Howard. Ai conseguimos ver que ela e cheia de amor para partilhar, so precisa de alguem a quem o oferecer. Como e muito genuina e verdadeira acaba por magoar os outros, porem a compreensao que eles tem para com ela e extremamente importante. 
 Bertha e Gus sao uma casal excecional. O amor, a partilha, a compreensao, os bons sentimentos habitam dentro deles com uma forca desconhecida. Eles exercem uma verdadeira parentalidade positiva com a Charlie. Sao pais no coracao, apesar de a natureza nao lhe permitir extrapolar esse amor parental que habita dentro e entre eles. 
 Nao podia deixar de falar no Howard... Que miudo consciente e de bem consigo proprio. Identifica os seus defeitos e sabe lidar com eles de uma forma muito natural. Fiquei deliciada com a sua dedicacao a Charlie. Gostava que houvessem mais miudos assim. Faceis de encontrar e que iluminam qualquer vida. 
 Pessoalmente, nao consigo dizer o que e mais me tocou o coracao. Quando olho para o livro sei que sera por muito tempo que vou recordar a natureza esperancosa e corajosa da Charlie, o amor e encanto que Bertha e Gus partilham entre eles e com o mundo que decidem abracar e a docura e assertividade de Howard a lidar com o mundo que nem sempre e simpatico com ele. 
 Do meu ponto de vista e um livro excelente para ser lido em conjunto com criancas. Atraves dele podemos chegar a reflexao de temas extremamente importantes para o desenvolvimento infantil. Questoes como o bullying, a familia, a agressividade, a importancia de acreditar e mantermos a esperanca sao temas que habitam estas paginas e que podem ajudar outras criancas. Sem duvida, um livro merecedor da nossa atencao.

children,"I found this story appropriate for young children to understand the dynamics of the holocaust, and inspire them to help out others even when it is dangerous to do so. 
 The story is told through the perspective of a 10ish year old girl, complete with all her insecurities and jealousies. The reality of the situation is stark, and it is emphasized that the children did not have enough food. I think it best to deal with such a heavy theme in small doses and this book is not long, at 76 pages divided into 5 chapters. The children display courage, bravery and cleverness in a dangerous situation. And, partly due to one of the investigators being 'on the right side', it has a happy ending. 
 I found it helpful to step away from the storyline to ask my student questions that would help to clarify the tension. Why was the chocolate so exciting? How long have you gone without having ANY chocolate? Where is Sister Gabriel? Are the Nazi soldiers good or evil? What is the children's plan? etc. In case of jam ups, I provide multiple choice answers. 
 This book made an excellent complement to our modern history study. However, the subject matter may be frightening for young children, and parents of sensitive children will want to preview it. Also, the book does not provide any background. It merely states that the children were in France during WWII and that France was occupied by the Germans. Children unfamiliar with the setting will need more information and should probably not be exposed to this book without it. 
 This is a strong contribution in a difficult genre. Highly recommended.",4

Of course it introduces Michonne too, but she feels primarily like a problem in this book, not anyone really special.

mystery_thriller_crime,"I live on the Central Coast of California, where it's borderline heresy to be anything less than a huge fan of beloved local author Laurie King. True confession time: I admit it, I tried a couple of her books and they just didn't grab me. But seeing that her latest book, Lockdown, was subtitled ""A Novel of Suspense,"" and that it was set in a middle school in a small rural town on the central coast (that sounded eerily like the one where my husband worked for many years) made me LEAP at the opportunity to read an advance copy! (Thanks to NetGalley and Random House - Ballantine.) 
 The setting is Guadalupe Middle School, where Principal Linda McDonald (who has been in charge for the past year) has been working tirelessly to change the culture from that of a gang-ridden, crime infested school to...something else. The story takes place on a single day, with flashback chapters interspersed to present the backstories for some of the characters (including Linda and her husband Gordon, who routinely helps out and supports his wife in her professional endeavor). Another main character is local cop Olivia, who intuits that Gordon has a mystery that might be revealed if she were to use her law enforcement resources to do some sleuthing. 
 As Linda gets to school, it is the morning of her long-awaited undertaking: Career Day, when she hopes to present students with ideas and options that might inspire them to escape their environment. ""They gym would be packed to the rafters with seven hundred-plus adolescents, on the brink of boiling over, into impatience, mockery, even the violence that was never far away."" The students are ""ages eleven to fourteen. Half child, half adult, all hormones and passion..."" One of the invited speakers, Thomas Atcheson, who plans to speak about the tech industry, has a different perspective: """"Career Day."" What an exercise in futility! Urging ill-trained children to become entrepreneurs was like telling finger-painters to aim for the Sistine Chapel: those with drive required no encouragement."" 
 Other important characters include the Coach and several students: the basketball star, the cousin of the gang member on trial for murdering a beautiful young girl, and the victim's sister. Then there is the janitor, an immigrant who has a secret and takes a huge interest in the community. 
 Told from alternating perspectives, the story of Guadalupe's Career Day its effect on several people's lives, is filled with tension, mystery and outstanding character development. I love the way Ms. King presented the school in a way that anyone who has worked with students in middle or high school will recognize: ""...even the oldest, most sneering of these adolescents harbored secret pockets of hope, a hidden belief that the world might still hold out an outstretched hand in place of a fist."" 
 Impossible to say more without spoiling, which I NEVER do! But it's well written, a relatively quick read with memorable characters. Five stars.",5

 Oh, Boy! K.A. Merikan have done it again with another great dark story. This is technically part 2 in a series but can be read as a standalone as they're all new characters. Tooth who happens to be the VP of the Coffin Nails MC is on a mission to avenge a long lost lover, which is why he ended up with the MC to start with. However, the last thing he wants is to babysit the president's kid. 
 Lucifer has lost everything and does what he needs to do to survive, which is hook. Minding his own business he ends up smack in the world of the Coffin Nail MC with his long lost dad who happens to be president and has a thing for satan as well as under the supervision of the VP of the club, Tooth. 
 To protect himself, Lucifer takes risk and shoots off his mouth more often than not, but he can't to far with the short leash of Tooth. As Tooth invades his world with a tight hold, he starts to get unrequited feelings for this straight man but he also gets other mixed signals. Tooth has been down this road before and he doesn't want to give into his desires and screw over his president by being with Lucifer but he couldn't hold out forever. 
 As Tooth and Lucifer give in to their carnal desires they both land into the middle of a shit storm with the MC, organ snatchers and Tooth's past. With the first book in this series it took quite awhile to get momentum and for me to like the book, but with this one I was hooked from the beginning. However, it took for-frigging-ever for the naughty business to come to fruition, but once it did, Yowza. 
 As usual with K.A. Merikan, this book was edgy, raw, dark and unique. I enjoyed it from start to finish, I will admit to date, my favorite K.A. Merikan series so far is still the Guns n' Boys series but this one is another goody.

history_biography,"When a frustrated reader came across the line, ""Mondale carefully mingled praise of Reagan with his attack, giving the impression that he was being fair to the president even while he was saying that he was not up to the job,"" he or she couldn't resist underlining it and scribbling in the margin: ""Just like Lou Cannon in writing this book."" Normally I get quite annoyed when people write in library books, but I'll make an exception in this case. I, too was shocked at the negative portrayal of Reagan in this book, especially after reading Cannon's later book, Governor Reagan: His Rise To Power. I suspect a lot of what is going on here is that this book was written shortly after Reagan left office, and the opinion of him among political scientists was not very good. The book about Governer Reagan was written 12 years later, when the opinion of Reagan had changed. Or, perhaps Reagan was just a better governor than he was a president. At any rate, there's tons of great info in this book, but it was marred by the over-the-top negative tone and the less-than-wonderful organization.",3

 So I'm a huge fan of this series and was so looking forward to this book as I thought it was a trilogy so I was a bit frustrated to find out there will be a fourth book but hey I'm a huge Julian fan so another book will be just fine in my world. 
 With this book we FINALLY get to have Julian and Anna together with a few hiccups along the way. 
 As well as the truth FINALLY coming out. 
 This book was sweet and it felt a bit more like a bridge or filler book but it needed to happen so it gives us a bigger look into Julian and Anna which is important especially after the sneak peak from book 4, which caused my jaw to drop as I so did not see that coming at all. 
 I like how this series has developed and the finish line looks like its going to be awesome with a bumpy ride still ahead. 
 Team Julian all the way!

 Meghan Chase has become the Iron Queen - the ruler of the Iron Fey and Kingdom - and seems to be at relative peace with the Winter and Summer courts. Everything is as it should be, or so it seems. In her final act before she became queen, Meghan released Prince Ash of the Winter court from his promise of knighthood and banished him from the Iron Realm. She knew that if she died, he would follow her soon after and she didn't want that on her conscious. But she didn't die and now Ash has to try and make his way back to her side. 
 The problem though is that he's been banished from the Iron Realm and he is still a Winter court faery. The touch of iron could kill him, so he is on a mission. First to find the cat Grimalkin and then to somehow find a soul so that way he can become a mortal and be by Meghan's side. But the task is not easy. For one thing, the jester Puck has decided to join him on his journey and they still have a centuries old feud to put to bed. For another, the journey is perilous and brings out the darker side of Ash, a side he thought he had locked away, and he eventually does turn on his once friend. But when it comes time to deal the killing blow - one that Puck willingly gives him - he can't do it. But that doesn't matter, because what happens next challenges his vow to come back to Meghan's side.",4
mystery_thriller_crime,"I figured since this is billed as the first detective novel, it would be kind of quaint. The culprit would either be easy to spot from a mile away, or else totally off the wall like in ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"", and nothing would happen in the story that I hadn't already seen in a thousand other mysteries. Fortunately, none of those things were true. At one point about a third of the way through the book, I was sure I knew what was going on, and I sighed to think I'd have to struggle through another 200+ pages before having it confirmed. To my surprise, two pages later the detective came to the same conclusion I had, and, as it turned out, both of us were completely wrong! Yet when the solution did come, it made perfect sense and seemed like something that everybody should have guessed all along. 
 Other things I really liked about this story were the narration that switches between several different characters about events that they personally witnessed, almost as if they are testifying in a trial, and the fact that the solution takes years to arrive at, with most of the detective work not being done by the actual detective. (In fact, by the time the solution is found, he has to be pulled out of retirement in order to witness it!) 
 This was a much better story than I had any expectation of it being, and if you are a fan of the genre, you should read it. (Bonus points if you're already familiar with other novels of this time period like Little Women.)",4
fantasy_paranormal,I was a little disappointed with this book. She is a great story teller and I was interested while I read but when I would think about the actual plotline I realized that nothing much seemed to be happening in the book. And I was very disappointed by the end. It was nothing like the other books endings have been. While I love Bella and Edward and Jacob this book was rather an anticlimatic ending to their story. Hopefully there will be more spin off stories from these books that will make this story seem more fulfilling.,4
comics_graphic,"The titular ""Betrothal of Sontar"" is a nice story with great artwork and really good focus on the Sontarans [7/10]. Though not as good as the TV episode, ""The Lodger"" is good fun [8/10]. ""FAQ"" is a little slow at times, but is a fun little story [6/10]. ""The Futurists"" is a good story that makes fun use of time travel and has a great scope [7/10]. ""Interstellar Overdrive"" starts off slow, but has some fun timey-wimeyness in its second part [6/10]. ""Opera of Doom"" is another OK but forgettable story [5/10]. ""The Green-Eyed Monster"" is a great laugh [8/10]. ""The Warkeeper's Crown"" is an OK final story. I'm never fond of these pseudo-fantasy romps, and the plot is all over the place, but it's good to see the Brigadier one more time. [6/10] The authors' commentaries that end the volume really knock everything up a notch [9/10].",4
comics_graphic,"For those so interested, the copy I'm reading is here. 
 To know thine enemy ... one must read their writings. But, in doing so with Dr. Frederic Wertham, I noticed that there was more similarities in the way he and I thought, than differences. The premise of this book, by the way, was not to ban comics forever (though, shortsighted that he was, he did not see the artistry they would become in the future) but rather institute a restriction on who can buy which comics at what age. You know, what we have in place for movies, video games, some music and even books now. He wanted to take the ""Crime Comic Books"" (which included the Suspenstories as well as Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman) and restrict those to the 15 and older crowd. 
 For those who refuse to read it (or try and can't get past the fact that this is an editorial essay on the evils of comic books), here's the main arguments: a) the linking of violence and sexual imagery has created sado-masochists, b) the prevalence of gorier scenes in comic books have forced other media to follow suit (namely television and movies), c) the crowd being targeted by the ads are too young to understand the ""motives"" (when any are given) behind the scenes of violence if they even see more than just the pictures, d) all of this combined creates an atmosphere where delinquency is viewed as normal and powerful and morality is viewed as passe and weak. 
 In the end, I do believe that there does need to be a balance between those comics meant for little kids and those that are meant for more adult readers. I also believe that finding a way to let the little kids who still need to learn balanced emotional health have access to only those comics which do not glorify what is destructive to societies is wise. 
 However, I do disagree with a few of his main reasons for the arguments (besides the general well-being of the children). First, if his only interaction has been with children who ""became maladjusted"" after reading these books, than it doesn't matter if they really are a minority, his whole point of view is skewed. And in a democracy - a true democracy - there is rule by majority. What we have done in the US (supposedly) is try to take into account the minority opinions also and balance out the majority versus the minority, but he claims that rule by majority is not democracy at all. He claims, in fact, that by letting the majority rule, we are preventing democracy from occurring. Also, he claims that comic books have no redeeming value and this is a horrible falsehood. The fact that he didn't recognize a burgeoning art when it was being birthed is a big problem. That he could not see they would have literary value (and, in fact, did at times back then also), is unfortunate. 
 That these same arguments have been used for movies, television, video games, music and will be continued to be used forever is a tragedy of our world. Those who make the arguments do have the society's best interest at heart, I do not doubt that. But that we can't find other ways of helping educate all people in finding and praising the ""good"" as well as the ""horror"" is the root of the problem. 
 As far as his writing goes, it was fun to read someone so sarcastic.",4
history_biography,"An excellent overview of the life of Elizabeth I, Susan Doran manages to provide sufficient detail without becoming bogged down in extensive analysis. She also naturally assumes that Elizabeth was an intelligent woman who was fully capable of ruling a nation during a time of great religious, economic, and social upheaval. Unlike many historians, Doran does not belittle Elizabeth's accomplishments by attempting to attribute them to the men behind the scenes. For this reason alone, Doran's biography stands out from the crowded multitude of Elizabethan biography.",5

 I wasn't sure if they would make a good match being sooooo opposite but I was proven wrong they were perfect together. I loved what they brought out in each other.
