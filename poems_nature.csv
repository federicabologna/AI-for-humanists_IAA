1-0001,Home-Coming,Tang,He Zhizhang,"Oh, I return to the homeland I left while young, Thinner has grown my hair, though I speak the same tongue. My children, whom I meet, do not know who am I, ""Where are you from, dear sir?"" they ask with beaming eyes.",0
1-0002,The Willow Tree,Tang,He Zhizhang,The slender tree is dressed in emerald all about; Thousands of branches droop like fringes made of jade. But do you know by whom these slim leaves are cut out? The wind of early spring ís sharp as scissor blade.,1
1-0003,Out of the Great Wall,Tang,Wang Zhihuan,The yellow sand uprises as high as white cloud; The lonely town is lost amid the mountains proud. Why should the Mongol flute complain no willows grow? Beyond the Gate of Jade no vernal wind will blow.,0
1-0004,On the Stork Tower,Tang,Wang Zhihuan,The sun beyond the mountain glows; The Yellow River seawards flows. You can enjoy a grander sight By climbing to a greater height.,0
1-0005,Mooring on the River at Jiande,Tang,Meng Haoran,My boat is moored near an isle in mist grey; I'm grieved anew to see the parting day. On boundless plain trees seem to scrape the sky; In water clear the moon appears so nigh.,1
1-0006,Starting for the Front,Tang,Wang Han,"With wine of grapes the cups of jade would glow at night; Drinking to pipa songs, we are summoned to fight. Don't laugh if we lay drunken on the battleground, How many warriors ever came back safe and sound?",0
1-0007,On the Frontier,Tang,Wang Changling,"The moon still shines on mountain passes as of yore. How many guardsmen of Great Wall come back no more! If the Flying General were still there in command, No hostile steeds would have dared to invade our land.",0
1-0008,Army Life,Tang,Wang Changling,"Clouds on frontier have darkened mountains clad in snow; The town with Gate of Jade stands far away, forlorn. We will not leave the desert till we beat the foe, Although in war our golden armour be outworn.",0
1-0009,Farewell to a Friend at Lotus Tower,Tang,Wang Changling,A cold rain mingled with East Stream invades the night; At dawn you leave the lonely Southern Hill in haze. If my friends in the North should ask if I'm all right. My heart is free of stain as ice in crystal vase.,0
1-0010,The Bamboo Hut,Tang,Wang Wei,"Sitting among bamboos alone, I play my lute and croon carefree. In the deep woods where I'm unknown, Only the bright moon peeps at me.",0
1-0011,A Farewell Song,Tang,Wang Wei,No dust is raised on the road wet with morning rain; The willows by the hotel look so fresh and green. I invite you to drink a cup of wine again; West of the sunny pass no more friends will be seen.,1
1-0012,On Mission to the Frontier,Tang,Wang Wei,"A single carriage goes to the frontier; As envoy I cross northwest mountains high, Like tumbleweed I leave our fortress drear; As wild geese I come under Tartar sky. In boundless desert lonely smoke rises straight; Over endless river the sun sinks round, I meet a cavalier at the camp gate; In Northern Fort the general will be found.",0
1-0013,Thinking of My Brothers on Mountain-Climbing Day,Tang,Wang Wei,"Alone, a lonely stranger in a foreign land, I doubly pine for kinsfolk on a holiday. I know my brothers would, with dogwood spray in hand, Climb the mountain and think of me so far away.",0
1-0014,Passing by the Northern Mountains,Tang,Wang Wan,"My boat goes by green mountains high, And passes through the river blue. The banks seem wide at the full tide; A sail with ease hangs in soft breeze. The sun brings light born of last night; New spring invades old year which fades. How can I send word to my friend? Homing wild geese, fly westward please!",0
1-0015,SeekingShelter in Lotus Hill on a Snowy Night,Tang,Liu Changqing,At sunset hills side village still seems far; Cold and deserted the thatched cottages are. At wicket gate a dog is heard to bark; With wind and snow I come when night is dark.,1
1-0016,For an Absent Recluse,Tang,Jia Dao,"I ask your lad beneath a pine. ""My master has gone for herbs fine. He stays deep in the mountain proud, I know not where, veiled by the cloud.""",0
1-0017,Mooring by Maple Bridge at Night,Tang,Zhang Ji,"At moonset cry the crows, streaking the frosty sky; Dimly lit fishing boats beneath maples sadly lie. Beyond the city walls, from Temple of Cold Hill Bells break the ship-borne roamer's dream and midnight still.",1
1-0018,Cold Food Day,Tang,Han Yi,There's nowhere in spring town but flowers fall from trees; On Cold Food Day royal willows slant in east breeze. At dusk the palace sends privileged candles red To the five lordly mansions where wreaths of smoke spread.,1
1-0019,On the West Stream of Chuzhou,Tang,Wel Yingwu,"Alone I like the riverside where green grass grows And golden orioles sing amid the leafy trees. When showers fall at dusk, the river overflows; A lonely boat athwart the ferry floats at ease,",1
1-0020,Song of the Parting Son,Tang,Meng Jiao,"The thread in mother's hand- A gown for parting son, Sewn stitch by stitch, alas! For fear of cold he'll stand. Such kindness of warm sun Cant be repaid by grass.",1
1-0021,A Border Song,Tang,Lu Lun,In gloomy woods grass shivers at wind's howl; The general takes it for a tiger's growl. He shoots and seeks his arrow-plume next morn Only to find a rock pierced amid the thorn.,0
1-0022,Bamboo Branch Song,Tang,Liu Yuxi,"Between the willows green the river flows along, My gallant on the stream is heard to sing a song The west is veld in rain, the east enjoys sunshine My gallant is as deep in love as the day is fine.",1
1-0023,The Street of Mansions,Tang,Liu Yuxi,"Beside the Bridge of Birds rank grasses overgrow; Over the Mansion Street the setting sun hangs low. Swallows that skimmed by painted eaves in bygone days Are dipping now among the humble homes' doorways,",1
1-0024,Lake Dongting Viewed from Afar,Tang,Liu Yuxi,"The autumn moon dissolves in soft light of the lake, Unruffled surface like unpolished mirror bright. Afar, the isle amid water clear without a break Looks like a spiral shell in a plate silver-white.",1
1-0025,Ripples Sifting Sand,Tang,Liu Yuxi,The long long winding Yellow River's paved with sand Sifted by waves and tossed by winds from far-off land Now it goes up straight to the Starry River Way To meet the Cowherd and Weaving Maid far away.,1
1-0026,The Town of Stone,Tang,Liu Yuxi,"The changeless hills round ancient capital still stand; Waves beating on ruined walls, unheeded, roll away. The moon that shone by riverside on flourished land Still shines at dead of night over ruined town today.",0
1-0027,Song of Autumn,Tang,Liu Yuxi,"Since olden days we fel in autumn sad and drear, But I say spring cannot compete with autumn clear On a fine day a crane cleaves the clouds and soars high; It leads the poet's lofty mind to azure sky.",1
1-0028,Reply to Bai Juyi Whom I Meet for the First Time at a Banquet in Yangzhou,Tang,Liu Yuxi,"O Western Mountains and Southern Streams desolate, Where I, an exile, lived for twenty years and three! To mourn for my departed friends I come too late; In native land I look but like human debris. A thousand sails pass by the side of sunken ship; Ten thousand flowers bloom ahead of injured tree. Today I hear you chant the praises of friendship; I wish this cup of wine might well inspirit me.",0
1-0029,The Peasants (I),Tang,Li Shen,Each seed that's sown in spring Will make autumn yields high. What will fertile fields bring? Of hunger peasants die.,0
1-0030,The Peasants (II),Tang,Li Shen,At noon they hoe up weeds; Their sweat drips on the soil. Who knows the rice that feeds Is the fruit of hard toil!,0
1-0031,Going up the Hill,Tang,Du Mu,"I go by slanting stony path to the cold hill; Where rise white cloudy, there appear cottages and bowers. I stop my cab in maple woods to gaze my fill; Frost-bitten leaves look redder than early spring flowers.",1
1-0032,The Mourning Day,Tang,Du Mu,"A drizzling rain falls like tears on the mourning day; The mourner's heart is going to break on his way. ""Where can a wine-shop be found to drown my sad hours?"" A cowherd points to a cot amid apricot flowers.",1
1-0033,An Autumn Night,Tang,Du Mu,Autumn has chilled the painted screen in candlelight; A palace maid uses a fan to catch fireflies. The steps seem steeped in water when cold grows the night; She sits to watch two stars in love meet in the skies.,1
1-0034,The Summer Palace,Tang,Du Mu,"Viewed from afar, the hills paved with brocades in piles, The palace doors on hilltops opened one by one. A steed raising red dust won the fair mistress' smiles. How many steeds bringing her fruit died on the run!",0
1-0035,The Red Cliff,Tang,Du Mu,"We dig out broken halberds buried in the sand, And wash and rub these relics of an ancient war. Had the east wind refused to give a helping hand, Southern beauties would have been captives on northern shore.",0
1-0036,Moored on River Qinhuai,Tang,Du Mu,"Cold river with sand bars veiled in misty moonlight, I moor on River Qinhuai near wineshops at night. The songstress knowing not the grief of conquered land, Still sings the song composed by a captive king's hand.",0
1-0037,On the Plain of Tombs,Tang,Li Shangyin,"At dusk my heart is filled with gloom; I drive my cab to ancient tomb. The setting sun seems so sublime, O but 'tis near its dying time!",0
1-0038,The Sad Zither,Tang,Li Shangyin,"Why should the zither sad have fifty strings? Each string, each strain evokes but vanished springs. Dim morning dream to be a butterfly; Amorous heart poured out in cuckoo's cry. In moonlit pearls see tears in mermaid's eyes; From sunburnt emerald watch vapor rise! Such feeling cannot be recalled again; It seemed long lost even when it was felt then.",0
1-0039,Written on a Rainy Night to a Friend in the North,Tang,Li Shangyin,You ask me when I can come back but I don't know. The pools in Western Hills with autumn rain overflow. When by our window can we trim the wicks again And talk about this endless dreary night of rain?,0
1-0040,Early Departure,Tang,Wen Tingyun,"At dawn I rise and my cab bells begin To ring, but in thoughts of home I am lost. The cock crows as the moon sets over thatched inn; Footprints are left on wood bridge paved with frost. The mountain path is covered with oak leaves; The posthouse bright with blooming orange trees. The dream of my homeland still haunts and grieves With mallards playing on the pool with geese.",0
1-0041,A Fisherman,Tang,Liu Zongyuan,Under western cliff a fisherman passes the night; At dawn he makes bamboo fire to boil water clean. Mist clears off at sunrise but there's no man in sight; Only the fisherman's song turns hill and rill green. He goes down mid-stream and turns to look on the sky. What does he see but clouds freely wafting on high.,1
1-0042,On Hearing Bai Juyi Degraded to Riverside Town,Tang,Yuan Zhen,"In flameless dying lamplight heavy shadows creep; Tonight I'm told you're degraded to the city old. Before death, I rise from bed in surprise deep; The dark wind blows the rain into my window cold.",0
1-0043,Song of Li Ping's Twenty-three Strings,Tang,Li He,"The Southern strings on Western chest played in autumn high, The congealed clouds over empty mountains will not fly. The lutists after the king's death would weep to hear Li Ping playing his twenty-three strings and feel drear. Broken jade or dew-shedding lotus is not more sad; Nor is phoenix' song or sweet orchid's smile more glad. Before the Twelve Gates melts away cold light aglow; His twenty-three strings move emperors high and low. The Goddess forgets to mend the sky with might and main; The stones fall down from on high like torrential rain. Celestial lutists wake from dreams in mountains deep; Slender dragons dance and old fish on the waves leap. The sleepless woodcutter leans on the laurel tree; The rabbit wet and cold with dew crouches with glee.",0
1-0044,Song of the Swan Gate,Tang,Li He,"Dark clouds over the town threaten to crush it down; Like golden scales the armor glistens in sunlight. Blowing up to the sky, horns take an autumn dye; Rougelike blood on the frontier turns violet at night. With red flags half furled up, our troops come near North Stream; Muffled by heavy frost, their drumbeats can't be heard. To fulfill the sovereign's Golden Tower dream, Jade dragon sword in hand, they'd die without a word.",0
1-0045,Song of White Snow in Farewell to Secretary Wu Going Back to the Capital,Tang,Cen Shen,"Snapping the pallid grass, the northern wind whirls low; In the eighth moon the Tartar sky is filled with snow As if the vernal breeze had come back overnight, Adorning thousands of pear trees with blossoms white. Flakes enter pearled blinds and wet the silken screen; No furs of fox can warm us nor brocade quilts green. The general cannot draw his rigid bow with ease; Even the commissioner in coat of mail would freeze. A thousand feet over cracked wilderness ice piles, And gloomy clouds hang sad and drear for miles and miles. We drink in headquarters to our guest homeward bound; With Tartar lutes, pipas and pipes the camps resound. Snow in large flakes at dusk falls heavy on camp gate; The frozen red flag in the wind won't undulate. At eastern gate of Wheel Tower we bid goodbye On the snow-covered road to Heaven's Mountain high. I watch his horse go past a bend and, lost to sight, His track will soon be buried up by snow in flight.",0
1-0046,Yellow Crane Tower,Tang,Cui Hao,"The sage on yellow crane was gone amid clouds white. To what avail is Yellow Crane Tower left here? Once gone, the yellow crane will never on earth alight; Only white clouds still float in vain from year to year. By sunlit river trees can be counted one by one; On Parrot Islet sweet green grass grows fast and thick. Where is my native land beyond the setting sun? The mist-veiled waves of River Han make me homesick.",1
1-0047,Written for My Grandnephew at the Blue Pass,Tang,Han Yu,"To the Celestial Court a proposal was made, And I'm banished eight thousand miles away. To undo the misdeeds I would have given aid. Dare I have spared myself with powers in decay? The Ridge veiled in barred clouds, my home can't be seen; The Blue Pass covered by snow, my horse won't forward go. You have come from afar and I know what you mean; Not to leave my bones there where misty waters flow.",0
1-0048,Farewell beyond the Thorn-gate Gorge,Tang,Li Bai,"Leaving Mount Thorn-gate far away, My boat pursues its eastward way. Where mountains end begins the plain; The river rolls to boundless main. The moon, celestial mirror, flies; The clouds like miraged towers rise. The water that from homeland flows Will follow me where my boat goes.",0
1-0049,Hard is the Way of the World,Tang,Li Bai,"Pure wine in golden cup costs ten thousand coins, good! Choice dish in a jade plate is worth as much, nice food! Pushing aside my cup and chopsticks, I can't eat; Drawing my sword and looking round, I hear my heart beat. I cant cross Yellow River: ice has stopped its flow; I cant climb Mount Taihang: the sky is blind with snow. I poise a fishing pole with ease on the green stream Or set sail for the sun like the sage in a dream. Hard is the way, Hard is the way. Don't go astray! Whither today? A time will come to ride the wind and cleave the waves; I'll set my cloudlike sail to cross the sea which raves.",0
1-0050,Joking with Du Fu,Tang,Li Bai,"On top of Hill of Boiled Rice I met with Du Fu, Who in the noonday sun wore a hat of bamboo. Pray, how could you have grown so thin since we did part? Is it because the verse-composing wrung your heart?",0
1-0051,Solitude,Tang,Li Bai,"I'm drunk with wine And with moonshine, With flowers fallen o'er the ground And o'er me the blue-gowned. Sobered, I stroll along the stream Whose ripples gleam. I see no bird And hear no word.",0
1-0052,The Ruin of the Capital of Yue,Tang,Li Bai,"The king of Yue returned, having destroyed the foe; His loyal men came home, with silken dress aglow. His palace thronged with flower-like ladies fair; Now we see but a flock of partridges flying there.",0
1-0053,"Farewell to Uncle Yun, the Imperial Librarian, at Xie Tiao's Pavilion in Xuanzhou",Tang,Li Bai,"What left me yesterday Can be retained no more; What troubles me today Is the times for which I feel sore. In autumn wind for miles and miles the wild geese fly, Let's drink, in face of this, in the pavilion high. Your writing's forcible like ancient poets while Mine is in Junior Xie's clear and spirited style. Both of us have an ideal high; We would reach the moon in the sky. Cut running water with a sword, 'twill faster flow; Drink wine to drown your sorrow, it will heavier grow. If we despair of all human affairs, Let us roam in a boat with loosened hairs!",0
1-0054,Sitting Alone in Face of Peak Jingting,Tang,Li Bai,"All birds have flown away, so high; A lonely cloud drifts on, so free. Gazing on Mount Jingting, nor I Am tired of him, nor he of me.",1
1-0055,My White Hair,Tang,Li Bai,"Long, long is my whitening hair; Long, long is it laden with care. I look into my mirror bright: From where comes autumn frost in sight?",0
1-0056,To Wang Lun,Tang,Li Bai,"I, Li Bai, sit aboard a ship about to go, When suddenly on shore your farewell songs o'erflow. However deep the Lake of Peach Blossoms may be, It's not so deep, O Wang Lun! As your love for me.",0
1-0057,Leaving the White Emperor Town at Dawn,Tang,Li Bai,Leaving at dawn the White Emperor crowned with cloud; I've sailed a thousand miles through Gorges in a day. With monkeys' sad adieux the riverbanks are loud; My skiff has left ten thousand mountains far away.,1
1-0058,Mount Skyland Ascended in a Dream -- A Song of Farewell,Tang,Li Bai,"Of fairy isles seafarers speak, 'Mid dimming mist and surging waves, so hard to seek; Of Skyland Southerners are proud, Perceivable through fleeting or dispersing cloud. Mount Skyland threatens heaven, massed against the sky, Surpassing the Five Peaks and dwarfing Mount Red Town. Mount Heaven's Terrace, five hundred thousand feet high, Nearby to the southeast, appears to crumbled down. Longing in dreams for Southern land, one night I flew o'er Mirror Lake in moonlight. My shadow's followed by moonbeams Until I reach Shimmering Streams, Where Hermitage of Master Xie can still be seen, And clearly gibbons wail ơ'er rippling water green. I put Xie's pegged boot Each on one foot, And scale the mountain ladder to blue cloud. On eastern cliff I see Sunrise at sea, And in mid-air I hear sky-cock crow loud. The footpath meanders 'mid a thousand crags in the vale, I'm lured by rocks and flowers when the day turns pale. Bears roar and dragons howl and thunders the cascade, Deep forests quake and ridges tremble: they are afraid! From dark, dark cloud comes rain; On pale, pale waves mists plane. Oh! lightning flashes And thunder rumbles, With stunning crashes Peak on peak crumbles. The stone gate of a fairy cavern under Suddenly breaks asunder. So blue, so deep, so vast appears an endless sky, Where sun and moon shine on gold and silver terraces high. Clad in the rainbow, riding on the wind, The Lords of Clouds descend in a procession long. Their chariots drawn by phoenix disciplined, And tigers playing for them a zither song. Row upon row, like fields of hemp, immortals throng. Suddenly my heart and soul stirred, I Awake with a long, long sigh. I find my head on pillow lie And fair visions gone by. Likewise all human joys will pass away Just as east-flowing water of olden day. I'll take my leave of you, not knowing for how long. I'll tend a white deer among The grassy slopes of the green hill So that I may ride it to famous mountains at will. How can I stoop and bow before the men in power And so deny myself a happy hour!",1
1-0059,Drinking Alone under the Moon,Tang,Li Bai,"Among the flowers, from a pot of wine I drink without a companion of mine. I raise my cup to invite the Moon who blends Her light with my Shadow and we're three friends. The Moon does not know how to drink her share; In vain my shadow follows me here and there. Together with them for the time I stay, And make merry before spring's spent away. I sing and the Moon lingers to hear my song; My Shadow's a mess while I dance along. Sober, we three remain cheerful and gay; Drunken, we part and each may go his way. Our friendship will outshine all earthly love; Next time we'll meet beyond the stars above.",1
1-0060,The Waterfall in Mount Lu Viewed from Afar,Tang,Li Bai,The sunlit Censer Peak exhales incenselike cloud; Like an upended stream the cataract sounds loud. Its torrent dashes down three thousand feet from high As if the Silver River fell from the blue sky.,1
1-0061,A Faithful Wife Longing for Her Husband in Spring,Tang,Li Bai,"With Northern grass like green silk thread, Western mulberries bend their head. When you think of home on your part, Already broken is my heart. Vernal wind, intruder unseen, O how dare you part my bed-screen!",1
1-0062,Invitation to Wine,Tang,Li Bai,"Do you not see the Yellow River come from the sky, Rushing into the sea and ne'er come back? Do you not see the mirrors bright in chambers high Grieve o'er your snow-white hair though once it was silk black? When hopes are won, oh! drink your fill in high delight, And never leave your wine-cup empty in moonlight! Heaven has made us talents, we're not made in vain. A thousand gold coins spent, more will turn up again. Kill a cow, cook a sheep and let us merry be, And drink three hundred cupfuls of wine in high glee! Dear friends of mine, Cheer up, cheer up! I invite you to wine. Do not put down your cup! I will sing you a song ,please hear, O hear! lend me a willing ear! What difference will rare and costly dishes make? I only want to get drunk and never to wake. How many great men were forgotten through the ages? But great drinkers are more famous than sober sages. The Prince of Poets feast'd in his palace at will, Drank wine at ten thousand a cask and laughed his fill. A host should not complain of money he is short, To drink with you I will sell things of any sort, My fur coat worth a thousand coins of gold And my flower-dappled horse may be sold To buy good wine that we may drown the woes age-old.",0
1-0063,Hard is the Road to Shu,Tang,Li Bai,"Oho! Behold! How steep! How high! The road to Shu is harder than to climb the sky. Since the two pioneers Put the kingdom in order, Have passed forty-eight thousand years, And few have tried to pass its border. There's a bird track o'er Great White Mountain to the west, Which cuts through Mountain Eyebrows by the crest. The crest crumbled, five serpent-killing heroes slain, Along the cliffs a rocky path was hacked then. Above stand peaks too high for the sun to pass o'er; Below the torrents run back and forth, churn and roar. Even the Golden Crane can't fly across; How to climb over, gibbons are at a loss. What tortuous mountain path Green Mud Ridge faces! Around the top we make nine turns each hundred paces, Looking up breathless, I can touch the stars nearby; Beating my breast, I sink aground with long, long sigh. When will you come back from this journey to the west? How can you climb up dangerous path and mountain crest, Where you can hear on ancient trees but sad birds wail And see the female birds fly, followed by the male? And hear home-going cuckoos weep Beneath the moon in mountains deep? The road to Shu is harder than to climb the sky, On hearing this, your cheeks would lose their rosy dye. Between the sky and peaks there is not a foot's space, And ancient pines hang, head down, from the cliffs' surface, And cataracts and torrents dash on boulders under, Roaring like thousands of echoes of thunder. So dangerous these places are, Alas! Why should you come here from afar? Rugged is the path between the cliffs so steep and high, Guarded by one And forced by none. Disloyal guards Would turn wolves and pards, Man-eating tigers at day-break And at dusk blood-sucking long snake. One may make merry in the Town of Silk, I know, But I would rather homeward go. The road to Shu is harder than to climb the sky, I'd turn and westward look with long long sigh.",1
1-0064,Seeing Meng Haoran off at Yellow Crane Tower,Tang,Li Bai,"My friend has left the west where the Yellow Crane tower For River Town veiled in green willows and red flowers. His lessening sail is lost in the boundless blue sky, Where I see but the endless River rolling by.",0
1-0065,Ballad of a Trader's Wife,Tang,Li Bai,"My forehead barely covered by my hair, Outdoors I pluck'd and played with flowers fair. On bobby horse you came upon the scene; Around the well we played with mumes still green. We lived, close neighbors on Riverside Lane, Carefree and innocent, we children twain. At fourteen years when I became your bride, I'd often turn my bashful face aside. Hanging my head, I'd look on the dark wall; I would not answer your call upon call. I was fifteen when I composed my brows; To mix my dust with yours were my dear vows. Rather than break faith, you declared you'd die. Who knew I'd live alone in tower high? I was sixteen when you went far away, Passing Three Gorges studded with rocks grey, Where ships were wrecked when spring flood ran high, Where gibbons' wails seemed coming from the sky. Green moss now overgrows before our door; Your footprints, hidden, can be seen no more. Moss can't be swept away, so thick it grows, And leaves fall early when the west wind blows. In yellow autumn butterflies would pass Two by two in west garden o'er the grass. This sight would break my heart and I'm afraid, Sitting alone, my rosy cheeks would fade. O when are you to leave the western land? Do not forget to tell me beforehand! I'll walk to meet you and not call it far E'en go to Long Wind Sands where you are.",0
1-0066,Thoughts on a Tranquil Night,Tang,Li Bai,"Before my bed a pool of light; Oh, can it be frost on the ground? Looking up, I find the moon bright; Bowing, in homesickness I'm drowned.",1
1-0067,Mount Heaven's Gate Viewed from Afar,Tang,Li Bai,"Breaking Mount Heaven's Gate, the great River rolls through; Green billows eastward flow and here turn to the north. From both sides of the River thrust out the cliffs blue; Leaving the sun behind, a lonely sail comes forth.",1
1-0068,To Meng Haoran,Tang,Li Bai,"Dear Master Meng, I hail you from the heart, Of your high value all the world is proud. Red-cheek'd, from cap to cab you kept apart; White haired, you lie beneath the pine and cloud. Drunken with wine as oft as with moonlight, You love the blooms too much to serve the crown. Of lofty mountain how to reach the height? We can but breathe your fragrance the wind brings down.",0
1-0069,A Recruiting Sergeant at Xin'an,Tang,Du Fu,"I pass by Xin'an on my way And hear sergeants call roll and bray. I ask one of this county small If he can draft adults at all. Last night came order for hands green, Draft age is lowered to eighteen. The teenagers are small and short. How can they hold the royal fort? Fat sons still need their mothers' care; Weak ones look lonely in despair. At dusk the pale stream flows east still; Their wails echo from hill to hill. Don't cry until your eyes go dry! Let no tears crisscross your face wry! Though to skin and bone your eyes go, No mercy would the Heaven show. Our force should take Xiangzhou with might, Victory expected day and night. But rebels not easy to beat Counter-attack, our troops retreat. We've grain enough in our stronghold, And training camp near capital old. To dig deep trench you do not need; It is not hard to tend the steed. The royal force has at its head General Guo by whom you're well fed. Don't shed at parting bloody tears! The general treats you as compeers.",0
1-0070,The Pressgang at Stone Moat Village,Tang,Du Fu,"I seek for shelter at nightfall. What is the pressgang coming for? My old host climbs over the wall; My old hostess answers the door. How angry is the sergeant's shout! How bitter is the woman's cry! I hear what she tries to speak out. ""I'd three sons guarding the town high. One wrote a letter telling me That his brothers were killed in war. He'll keep alive if he can be; The dead have passed and are no more. In the house there is no man left, Except my grandson in the breast Of his mother, of all bereft; She can't come out, in tatters dressed. Though I'm a woman weak and old, I beg to go tonight with you, That I may serve in the stronghold And cook morning meals as my due."" With might her voices fade away; I seem to hear still sob and sigh. At dawn again I go my way And only bid my host goodbye.",0
1-0071,Officer at the Western Pass,Tang,Du Fu,"How hard do soldiers work and toil, Building ramparts on western soil! Iron-clad bastions high and low Like walls along the mountain go. I ask an officer near by If against foes are built walls high. He asks me to dismount and look Around and points to mountain nook. The forts on the peaks scrape the sky, Over them even birds can't fly. When come the foe, we guard the wall, There's no fear for the capital. He shows me the narrow pass too, Only single chariots file through. When guarded with long spear by one, The fortress can be forced by none. But defeated at Peach Grove, alas! Ten thousand men slain at the pass. Please tell the general guarding here: Be not defeated as that year!",0
1-0072,Lament of the Newly Wed,Tang,Du Fu,"The creeper clinging to the flax is wrong, For it can't be expected to grow long. If a maiden to a soldier is tied In wedlock, better forsake her by roadside. My hair dressed up, to you I'm newly wed, But we have not yet warmed our nuptial bed. Married last night, at dawn we bid adieu. Why should I part in such hurry with you? Though you may not be very far away, Only in Heyang garrison you'll stay. I have not performed the rites of a wife. How can I serve your parents all my life? Bred by my parents, I was told it's right To hide indoors every day and night. Oh, I am destined to go to your house Like a hen or a dog to be your spouse. Now you go to a place in face of death, How can I not utter my painful breath? I would follow you wherever you go, But I fear it would bring less weal than woe. So forget the bride in your family then, But do your duty as all army men. If there were women in the camp, I fear, It's no good for morale on the frontier. As a daughter of a poor family, It's difficult to get silk robe for me. But I fear I could not wear it again, Rougeless and powderless I would remain. Looking up, I see hundreds of birds fly, Big or small, all of them in pairs on high. Why different should be our human fate? O how long, how long should I for you wait!",0
1-0073,Lament of an Old Man,Tang,Du Fu,"In all the country there's no peace. How can an old man live with ease? Sons and grandsons in battle slain, Why should my old body remain? Casting my staff away, I go; My companions compassion show. Fortunately my teeth are sound, But in my bones no marrow's found. As soldier clad in armor now, To officers I make a bow. By the roadside cries my wife old, So thinly clad in winter cold. Who knows if we can meet again? Seeing her shiver, I feel pain. Once gone, I can't come back, I fear; She still says, ""Eat more!""to my ear, I tell her the fortress is strong, To cross the stream takes a time long, Unlike the siege of days gone by, It's not so soon for me to die. To meet or part is fate in life, Whether with a young or old wife. Remembering when I was strong, Can I not heave sighs deep and long! War's raging in the countryside; Beacon fire blazes far and wide. Grass and trees stink with bodies dead; With blood the streams and plains turn red. Where can I find a happy land? Why do I tarry here and stand? Why not from my humble home part And march away with broken heart!",0
1-0074,Lament of a Homeless,Tang,Du Fu,"Since the rebellion I feel lone, My house with weeds is overgrown. A hundred homes can find no rest; People are scattered east and west. None knows where the living have fled, While to dust have returned the dead. My humble self after the defeat Come back to find my old retreat. I walk long on deserted lanes. The sun grows lean where drear air reigns. In face of bristling fox or cat, I am afraid to be growled at. How many neighbors left, all told? Only one or two widows old. A bird will not leave its own nest, My house, though poor, will give me rest. To hoe up weeds, in spring's my lot, At dusk I water garden plot, The magistrate knowing I've come Orders me to learn to beat drum. For service in my native land, I need not carry things in hand. Alone, I care not where to stay, Be it near by or far away. The land's in ruins and debris, The distance means nothing to me. Sick for five years, my mother died Unburied, with none by her side. She gave birth to me, is it wrong? How to repay her all life long? I have no home to say goodbye. What can poor people do but sigh!",0
1-0075,Temple of the Premier of Shu,Tang,Du Fu,"Where is the famous premier's temple to be found? Outside the Town of Brocade with cypresses around. In vain before the steps spring grass grows green and long, And amid the leaves golden orioles sing their song. Thrice the king visited him for the State's gains and pains; He served heart and soul the kingdom during two reigns. But he died before he accomplished his career. How could heroes not wet their sleeves with tear on tear!",0

With verdure spring's aglow, it's time we homeward go. We shall sail all the way through Three Gorges in a day. Going down to Xiangyang, we'll come up to Luoyang.",0
1-0078,Gazing at Mount Tai,Tang,Du Fu,"O peak of peaks, how high it stands! One boundless green o'erspreads two States. A marvel done by Nature's hands, O'er light and shade it dominates.

1-0079,Song of the Frontier,Tang,Du Fu,"The bow you carry should be strong; The arrows you use should be long. Before a horseman, shoot his horse; Capture the chief to beat his force!

1-0082,A Moonlit Night,Tang,Du Fu,"On the moon over Fuzhou which shines bright, Alone you would gaze in your room tonight. I'm grieved to think our little children are Too young to yearn for their father afar. Your cloudlike hair is moist with dew, it seems; Your jade-white arms would feel the cold moonbeams.

1-0083,Spring View,Tang,Du Fu,"On war-torn land streams flow and mountains stand; In vernal town grass and weeds are o'ergrown. Grieved o'er the years, flowers make us shed tears; Hating to part, hearing birds breaks our heart. The beacon fire has gone higher and higher; Words from household are worth their weight in gold. I cannot bear to scratch my grizzling hair; It grows too thin to hold a light hairpin.",0
1-0084,Happy Rain on a Spring Night,Tang,Du Fu,"Good rain knows its time right; It will fall when comes spring. With wind it steals in night; Mute, it moistens each thing. O'er wild lanes dark cloud spreads; In boat a lantern looms. Dawn sees saturated reds; The town's heavy with blooms.",1
1-0085,My Cottage Unroofed by Autumn Gales,Tang,Du Fu,"In the eighth moon the autumn gales furiously howl; They roll up three layers of straw from my thatched bower. The straw flies across the river and spreads in shower, Some hanging knotted on the tops of trees that tower, Some swirling down and sinking into water foul. Urchins from southern village know I'm old and weak, They rob me to my face without a blush on the cheek, And holding armfuls of straw, into bamboos they sneak. In vain I call them till my lips are parched and dry; Again alone, I lean on my cane and sigh. Shortly the gale subsides and clouds turn dark as ink; The autumn skies are shrouded and in darkness sink. My cotton quilt is cold, for years it has been worn; My restless children kick in sleep and it is torn. The roof leaks o'er beds, leaving no corner dry; Without cease the rain falls thick and fast from the sky. After the troubled times troubled has been my sleep. Wet through, how can I pass the night so long, so deep! Could I get mansions covering ten thousand miles, I'd house all scholars poor and make them beam with smiles. In wind and rain these mansions would stand like mountains high. Alas! Should these house appear before my eye, Frozen in my unroofed cot,content I'd die.",0
1-0086,On the Height,Tang,Du Fu,"The wind so swift, the sky so wide, apes wail and cry; Water so clear and beach so white, birds wheel and fly. The boundless forest sheds its leaves shower by shower; The endless river rolls its waves hour after hour, A thousand miles from home, I'm grieved at autumn's plight; I'll now and then for years, alone I'm on this height, Living in times so hard, at frosted hair I pine; Cast down by poverty, I have to give up wine.",1
1-0087,On Yueyang Tower,Tang,Du Fu,"Long have I heard of Dongting Lake, Now I ascend the Yueyang Height. Here eastern state and southern break; Here sun and moon float day and night.

1-0088,The Old Charcoal Seller,Tang,Bai Juyi,"What does the old man fare? He cuts the wood in southern hill and fires his ware. His face is grimed with smoke and streaked with ash and dust. His temples grizzled and his fingers all turned black. The money earned by selling charcoal is not just Enough for food for his mouth and clothing for his back. Though his coat is thin, he hopes winter will set in, For cold weather will keep up the charcoal's good price. At night a foot of snow falls outside city walls; At dawn his charcoal cart crushes ruts in the ice. The sun is high, the ox tired out and hungry he; Outside the southern gate in snow and slush they rest. Two riders canter up. Alas! who can they be? Two palace heralds in the yellow jackets dressed. Decree in hand, which is imperial order, one says; They turn the cart about and at the ox they shout. A cartload of charcoal a thousand catties weighs; They drive the cart away. What dare the old man say? Ten feet of silk and twenty feet of gauze deep red, That is the payment they fasten to the ox's head.",0
1-0089,Grass on the Ancient Plain —— Farewell to a Friend,Tang,Bai Juyi,"Wild grasses spread o'er ancient plain; With spring and fall they come and go. Fire tries to burn them up in vain; They rise again when spring winds blow. Their fragrance overruns the way; Their green invades the ruined town. To see my friend going away, My sorrow grows like grass o'ergrown.",0
1-0090,The Everlasting Regret,Tang,Bai Juyi,"The beauty-loving monarch longed year after year To find a beautiful lady without a peer. A maiden of the Yangs to womanhood just grown, In inner chambers bred, to the world was unknown. Endowed with natural beauty too hard to hide, She was chosen one day to be the monarch's bride. Turning her head, she smiled so sweet and full of grace That she outshone in six palaces the fairest face. She bathed in glassy water of Warm-fountain Pool Which laved and smoothed her creamy skin when spring was cool. Without her maids' support, she was too tired to move, And this was when she first received the monarch's love. Flower-like face and cloud-like hair, golden-headdressed, In lotus-adorned curtain she spent the night blessed. She slept tll the sun rose high for the blessed night was short, From then on the monarch held no longer morning court. In revels as in feasts she shared her lord's delight, His companion on trips and his mistress at night. In inner palace dwelt three thousand ladies fair, On her alone was lavished royal love and care. Her beauty served the night when dressed up in Golden Bower, She was drunk with wine and spring at banquet in Jade Tower. Her sisters and brothers all received rank and fief And honors showered on her household, to the grief Of fathers and mothers who would rather give birth To a fair maiden than to any son on earth. The lofty palace towered high into the cloud; With divine music borne on the breeze the air was loud. Seeing slow dance and hearing fluted or stringed song, The emperor was never tired the whole day long. But rebels beat their war drums, making the earth quake And ""Song of Rainbow Skirt and Coat of Feathers"" break, A cloud of dust was raised o'er city walls nine-fold; Thousands of chariots and horsemen southwestward rolled. Imperial flags moved slowly now and halted then. And thirty miles from Western Gate they stopped again. Six armies-what could be done-would not march with speed Unless fair Lady Yang be killed before the steed. None would pick up her hairpin fallen on the ground Nor golden bird nor comb with which her head was crowned. The monarch could not save her and hid his face in fear; Turning his head, he saw her blood mix with his tear. The yellow dust widespread, the wind blew desolate; A serpentine plank path led to cloud-capped Sword Gate. Below the Eyebrow Mountains wayfarers were few; In fading sunlight royal standards lost their hue, On Western water blue and Western mountains green The monarch's heart was daily gnawed by sorrow keen. The moon viewed from his tent shed a soul-searing light; The bells heard in night rain made a heart-rending sound. Suddenly turned the tide. Returning from his flight, The monarch could not tear himself away from the ground Where mid the clods beneath the Slope he couldn't forget The fair-faced Lady Yang who was unfairly slain. He looked at his courtiers, with tears his robe was wet; They rode east to the capital but with loose rein. Come back, he found her pond and garden in old place, With lotus in the lake and willows by the hall, Willow leaves like her brows and lotus like her face, At the sight of all these, how could his tears not fall? Or when in vernal breeze were peach and plum full-blown Or when in autumn rain parasol leaves were shed? In Western as in Southern Court was grass o'ergrown; With fallen leaves upswept the marble steps turned red, Actors, although still young, began to have hair grey. Eunuchs and waiting maids looked old in palace deep. Fireflies flitting the hall, mutely he pined away; The lonely lampwick bumed out, still he could not sleep. Slowly beat drums and rang bells, night began to grow long; Bright shone the Starry Stream, daybreak seemed to come late, The lovebird tiles grew chilly with hoar frost so strong; His kingfisher quilt was cold, not shared by a mate. One long, long year the dead with the living was parted; Her soul came not in dreams to see the broken-hearted. A taoist sorcerer came to the palace door, Skilled to summon the spirits from the other shore, Moved by the monarch's yearning for the departed fair. He was ordered to seek for her everywhere. Borne on the air, like flash of lightning flew; In heaven and on earth he searched through and through. Up to the azure vault and down to deepest place, Nor above nor below could he e'er find her trace. He learned that on the sea were fairy mountains proud, Which now appeared now disappeared amid the cloud Of rainbow colors, where rose magnificent bowers And dwelt so many fairies as graceful as flowers. Among them was a queen whose name was Ever True; Her snow-white skin and sweet face might afford a clue, Knocking at western gate of palace hall, he bade The fair porter to inform the queen's waiting maid, When she heard that there came the monarch's embassy, The queen was startled out of dreams in her canopy. Pushing aside the pillow, she rose and got dressed, Passing through silver screen and pearl shade to meet the guest. Her cloud-like hair awry, not full awake at all, Her flowery cap slanted, she came into the hall. The wind blew up her fairy sleeves and made them float As if she danced still ""Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Coat"". Her jade-white face crisscrossed with tears in lonely world Like a spray of pear blossoms in spring rain impearled. She bade him thank her lord, lovesick and broken-hearted; They knew nothing of each other after they parted, Love and happiness long ended within palace walls; Days and nights appeared long in the Fairyland halls. Turning her head and fixing on the earth her gaze, She found no capital'mid clouds of dust and haze. To show her love was deep, she took out keepsakes old For him to carry back, hairpin and case of gold. Keeping one side of the case and one wing of the pin; She sent to her lord the other half of the twin. ""If our two hearts as firm as the gold should remain, In heaven or on earth some time we'll meet again,"" At parting, she confided to the messenger A secret vow known only to her lord and her. On seventh day of seventh moon when none was near, At midnight in Long Life Hall he whispered in her ear: ""On high, we'd be two birds flying wing to wing; On earth, two trees with branches twined from spring to spring."" The boundless sky and endless earth may pass away, But this vow unfulfilled will be regretted for aye.",0
1-0091,Song of a Pipa Player,Tang,Bai Juyi,"Onc night by riverside I bade a friend goodbye; In maple leaves and rushes autumn seemed to sigh. My friend and I dismounted and came into the boat; We wished to drink but there was no music afloat. Without flute songs we drank our cups with heavy heart; The moonbeams blent with water when we were to part. Suddenly o'er the stream we heard a pipa sound; I forgot to go home and the guest stood spell-bound. We followed where the music led to find the player, But heard the pipa stop and no music in the air. We moved our boat towards the one whence came the strain, Brought back the lamp, asked for more wine and drank again. Repeatedly we called for the fair player till She came, her face half hidden behind a pipa still. She turned the pegs and tested twice or thrice each string; Before a tune was played we heard her feelings sing. Each string she plucked, each note she struck with pathos strong, All seemed to say she missed her dreams all her life long. Head bent, she played with unpremeditated art On and on to pour out her overflowing heart. She lightly plucked, slowly stroked and twanged loud The song of ""Green Waist"", after that of ""Rainbow Cloud"". The thick strings loudly thrummed like the pattering rain; The fine strings softly tinkled in a murmuring strain. When mingling loud and soft notes were together played, You heard large and small pearls cascade on plate of jade. Now you heard orioles warble in flowery land, Then a sobbing stream run along a beach of sand. But the stream seemed so cold as to tighten the string; From tightened strings no more sound could be heard to sing. Still we heard hidden grief and vague regret concealed; Then music expressed far less than silence revealed. Suddenly we heard water burst a silver jar, And the clash of spears and sabres coming from afar. She made a central sweep when the music was ending; The four strings made one sound, as of silk one is rending. Silence reigned left and right of the boat, east and west; We saw but autumn moon white in the river's breast. She slid the plectrum pensively between the strings, Smoothed out her dress and rose with a composed mien. ""I spent,"" she said, ""in the capital my early springs,"" Where at the foot of Mount of Toads my home had been. At thirteen I learned on the pipa how to play, And my name was among the primas of the day. I won my master's admiration for my skill; And my beauty was envied by deserted fair one. The gallant young men vied to shower gifts on me; One tuned played, countless silk rolls were given with glee. Beating time, I let silver comb and pin drop down, And spilt-out wine oft stained my blood-red silken grown. From year to year I laughed my joyous life away On moonlit autumn night or windy vernal day. My younger brother left for war, and died my maid; Days passed, nights came, and my beauty began to fade. Fewer and fewer were cabs and steeds at my door; I married a smug merchant when my prime was o'er. The merchant cared for money much more than for me; One month ago he went away to purchase tea, Leaving his lonely wife alone in empty boat; Shrouded in moonlight, on the cold river I float. Deep in the night I dreamed of happy bygone years And woke to find my rouged face crisscrossed with tears. Listening to her sad music, I sighed with pain; Hearing her story, I sighed again and again. ""Both of us in misfortune go from shore to shore. Meeting now, need we have known each other before? I was banished from the capital last ear To live degraded and ill in this city here. The city's too remote to know melodious song, So I have never heard music all the year long. I dwell by riverbank on a low and damp ground In a house with wild reeds and stunted bamboos around. What is here to be heard from daybreak till nightfall But gibbon's cry and cuckoo's homeward-going call? By blooming, riverside and under autumn moon I've often taken wine up and drunk it alone. Though I've mountain songs and village pipes to hear, Yet they are crude and strident and grate on the ear. Listening to you playing on pipa tonight, With your music divine e'en my hearing seems bring. Will you sit down and play for us a tune once more? I'll write for you an ode to the pipa I adore."" Touched by what I said, the player stood for long, Then sat down, tore at strings and played another song. So sad, so drear, so different, it moved us deep; Those who heard it hid the face and began to weep. Of all the company at table who wept most? It was none other than the exiled blue-robed host.",0
1-0092,The Moon over the Riverside Tower,Tang,Bai Juyi,"You stand by River Jialing, I by winding streams. Though far apart, still we share the same bright moonbeams. All night long I think of you and for you I pine, For I am not sure if you see the same moon shine. Who knows when by waterside I'm longing for you, By nocturnal riverside you're missing me too? When I receive your poem, I regret today: Why did I not send mine to you so far away?",1
1-0093,Sunset and Moonrise on the River,Tang,Bai Juyi,The departing sunbeams pave a way on the river; Half of its waves turn red and the other half shiver. How I love the third night of the ninth moon aglow! The dewdrops look like pearls; the crescent like a bow.,1
1-0094,The Lake in Spring,Tang,Bai Juyi,"What a charming picture when spring comes to the lake! Amid the rugged peaks water's smooth without a break. Hills upon hills are green with thousands of pine trees, The moon looks like a pearl swimming in waves with ease. Like a green carpet early paddy fields undulate, New rushes spread out as silk girdle fascinate. From fair Hangzhou I cannot tear myself away, On half my heart this lake holds an alluring sway.",1
